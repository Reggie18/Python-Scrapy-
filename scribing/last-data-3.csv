There has been an increased infection rate in the healthcare setting as a result of hand hygiene non-compliance by HCWs. Based on research ineffective hand hygiene compliance is said to be one of the primary contributing factors to healthcare-acquired infections (Engdaw et al. 2019). Healthcare-acquired infections are those infections that are either direct or indirect acquired in the healthcare setting (Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC) 2019). It also results to unnecessary suffering and pain for both patients and their families as well as prolong hospitalisation and increased healthcare cost (ACSQHC 2019).

You will read about ways to achieve positive tone in a negative message in the text readings. Structure Because people react negatively to bad news the message must be written and structured to prevent the reader from misinterpreting and being offended this is why bad news is most often written using an indirect pattern. To help the reader to see things from your perspective appeal to the reader's logic and sense of fairness. Convince them that you are refusing what they saw as a reasonable request by using good fair and consistently applied reasons. The Indirect Pattern helps convince readers. In the indirect pattern we begin with a neutral statement that does not foreshadow the bad news so readers will continue to read. In this statement we can show goodwill and/or reassure the reader that we intend to address their concerns. Then we describe the reasons for the bad news  hopefully consistently applied and fair logic policy or law  and then discuss the specific reader's request. The theory is that the reader will see the fairness of our criteria and then when we apply those criteria to their specific situation they'll see it's a fair decision.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/18/nur239-nursing-assignmentclinical-reasoning-3/,In this assessment task you are required to watch a video scenario of a team of health care professionals involved in managing the care of a deteriorating patient. As you view the scenario you might like to take notes. We know it is difficult to identify the roles of the healthcare staff in this video; the two female nursing staff are wearing the speckled blue shirts the female physiotherapist is wearing the red shirt the two male doctors are in the grey shirt and the blue scrub top and the female junior doctor is in the white shirt. The first part of the assessment requires you to critically reflect on the implementation of the A to E assessment framework (primary survey) by each individual and the team as a whole. This section is worth 45% of your marks for this assessment so it is important that you are clear on what you need to do well here. Think about what they did well and how they could improve in terms of a structured approach to the A to E assessment. What do you think about the choice of nursing and pharmacological interventions/considerations? What is considered best practice in the literature? Remember that scholarly literature isn't restricted to journal articles. Clinical practice guidelines are considered very high-level evidence guiding best-practice management of patients. It is important that you know where to find reliable evidence so that you can ensure the care you are providing to your patients for the rest of your career is considered best practice. Throughout your degree you will use the clinical reasoning cycle as the framework for learning how to think like a Registered Nurse. For this reason we would like to see you apply clinical reasoning as you evaluate the care provided to the deteriorating patient in the scenario. The second part of the assessment (which is worth 35% of your marks for the assignment) requires you to critically analyse the video scenario with a focus on the interprofessional communication and person-centred approach provided by the team and their impact on the patient outcome. At the end of module 1 we have provided (what we consider to be) an excellent summary of teamwork and interprofessional communication behaviours which promote patient safety (Levett-Jones 2020. p.39). We encourage you to use this table to assist with the analysis of the video scenario. Think about how the behaviours of the healthcare professionals contribute to effective interprofessional communication and the provision of person-centred care and how these behaviours may contribute to patient outcomes. In this section it is important that you make reference to the NMBA Registered Nurse Standards for Practice (2016) and the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards (2019) as you reflect on the interprofessional communication and person-centred care impact on patient outcomes. -You should write in complete sentences and structured paragraphs. Do not use bullet-point lists or tables to present your response. This task evidences achievement in following learning outcomes: ILO2: Apply the framework of clinical reasoning to deliver evidence-informed and person-centred care to individuals experiencing acute and chronic cardiovascular respiratory and renal health conditions and those experiencing surgical procedures. ILO3: Explain the physiological effects of medications on individuals with cardiac respiratory and renal conditions.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/19/hrm203-human-behaviour-in-organizations-research-monographs/,Conduct a literature review on the subject matter to write the Report. The number of articles to examine is A literature review is about digging into the body of knowledge that previous researchers have generated. Hence it is a written account of what has been published on a topic in periodicals research monographs serials and magazines. In writing the review your purpose is to convey what knowledge and ideas have already been established on the topic and what are their strengths and weaknesses. Your literature review will be defined by your research objective the problem or issue you are investigating. It should not be a few citations of the materials available or a set of summaries. An important skill for any researcher is the ability to review the work of others and evaluate their methods results and conclusions. How to go about it? You should organise your search of the literature around the key concepts you are going to examine. The first step is to assemble a list of probable key words related to what you are researching in. You can start your search using more general terms before limiting it to more specific terms. You can also look out for articles that list the relevant keywords for your topic which you then use to conduct more searches. Another way is to conduct a simple web search using a search enginee.g. Google Scholar or Researchgate. However online searches tend to generate huge number of entries.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/19/concerning-fixed-and-labour-costs/,There are broadly speaking three cost centres within a restaurant business being; fixed costs such as rent utilities equipment repairs & maintenance  insurance loans etc.; labour costs such as staff wages and superannuation; as well as food costs (Razmoski 2015). It is outside of the scope of this report to derive an operating net profit nor provide commentary concerning fixed and labour costs. This report has focused on the raw cost of goods sold in percentages as opposed to the net operating position of the company as per the provided brief. Food costs usually lay in the range of 25%-40% on average (Razmoski 2015) however this is not uniform across all the offerings on the menu. The previous òrule of thumb' for menu costings was once considered to be a third of cost to ingredients. However more recently due to rising costs (Heroux 2002) chefs have sought to keep food costs to 25% of turnover. Managers should be careful to ensure that their most popular lines have solid margins in place. Therefore it would be ideal to aim for food costs closer to 25% where possible. Despite this prices need to be based on what the market can bare not just a formula (Razmoski 2015)    Read less,Concerning Fixed and Labour Costs

His best friend Jordan owns Pawfect Fur Pty Ltd a dog food manufacturer called Pawfect Furù. Jordan's company is struggling financially due to the pandemic around the world and is not able to sell its products overseas. Jordan offers $50000.00 to Mark if Pawfect Fur Pty Ltd enters a supply agreement with Happy Pets Pty Ltd. Mark recommends Pawfect Fur Pty Ltd to Chloe the other director of Happy Pets Pty Ltd. Chloe explains that she does not have any knowledge on dog food and that she will let Mark make decisions in that area. Mark enters the supply agreement with Pawfect Fur Pty Ltd although he is aware that the Pawfect Fur dog food is famous for having a low quality product. The shareholders are not happy with this new agreement and threaten to take legal action against the Directors of Happy Pets Pty Ltd. Jean is a customer of Happy Pets Pty Ltd. One day she visited the store's website to purchase dog food for her dog. She notices that there is a promotion for Pawfect Fur dog food that says try before you buyù which will give her one week to try the dog food before she decides on the purchase. Payments will be processed after her confirmation of the purchase or after the one week expires. However Jean decides not to complete the purchase of the Pawfect Fur dog food and chooses to return the product. Happy Pets Pty Ltd refuses to accept the returned product as the one week trial period has already passed which means that Jean is now the owner of the product. The next day Jean's dog is very unwell. She was later advised by her vet that the dog is having stomach issues because of the Pawfect Fur dog food. She checks the packaging and realises that the dog food is one month past its expiry date. The vet recommends her dog should be hospitalised. Jean needs to pay $5000 for all the health treatment that is required. Use the IRAC method to advise the shareholders of Happy Pets Pty Ltd whether the Directors (Mark and Chloe) have breached their Director's Duties and if they have any defences.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/19/nur239-nursing-assignmentclinical-reasoning-4/,In this assessment task you are required to watch a video scenario of a team of health care professionals involved in managing the care of a deteriorating patient. As you view the scenario you might like to take notes. We know it is difficult to identify the roles of the healthcare staff in this video; the two female nursing staff are wearing the speckled blue shirts the female physiotherapist is wearing the red shirt the two male doctors are in the grey shirt and the blue scrub top and the female junior doctor is in the white shirt. The first part of the assessment requires you to critically reflect on the implementation of the A to E assessment framework (primary survey) by each individual and the team as a whole. This section is worth 45% of your marks for this assessment so it is important that you are clear on what you need to do well here. Think about what they did well and how they could improve in terms of a structured approach to the A to E assessment. What do you think about the choice of nursing and pharmacological interventions/considerations? What is considered best practice in the literature? Remember that scholarly literature isn't restricted to journal articles. Clinical practice guidelines are considered very high-level evidence guiding best-practice management of patients. It is important that you know where to find reliable evidence so that you can ensure the care you are providing to your patients for the rest of your career is considered best practice. Throughout your degree you will use the clinical reasoning cycle as the framework for learning how to think like a Registered Nurse. For this reason we would like to see you apply clinical reasoning as you evaluate the care provided to the deteriorating patient in the scenario. The second part of the assessment (which is worth 35% of your marks for the assignment) requires you to critically analyse the video scenario with a focus on the interprofessional communication and person-centred approach provided by the team and their impact on the patient outcome. At the end of module 1 we have provided (what we consider to be) an excellent summary of teamwork and interprofessional communication behaviours which promote patient safety (Levett-Jones 2020. p.39). We encourage you to use this table to assist with the analysis of the video scenario. Think about how the behaviours of the healthcare professionals contribute to effective interprofessional communication and the provision of person-centred care and how these behaviours may contribute to patient outcomes. In this section it is important that you make reference to the NMBA Registered Nurse Standards for Practice (2016) and the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards (2019) as you reflect on the interprofessional communication and person-centred care impact on patient outcomes. -You should write in complete sentences and structured paragraphs.

For this course assignment I would like each of the project teams to conduct their own research study on what we can learn from their investigation of a small sample of four entrepreneurial founders of successful start-up organizations. I have put together a list of the founders that I would like each team to use as their research sample (see attached file containing the list). As As you can see from the listings each team will be looking at and reporting on a different sample of founders. What are some of the critical learnings and key takeaways you can find from your brief investigation into their backgrounds and strategies for overcoming obstacles and creating successful organizational start-ups and eventual market successes. Consider where the ideas came from; how did they come up with them and what were the sources of the inspirations for the venture ideas   the problems frustrations changes in the overall situation or unexpected events that eventually focused their entrepreneurial efforts and undertakings. What marketing initiatives alternative choices or market segments did they undertake to get their ideas commercialized? Were there any obstacles or surprises that they had to face or overcome? How did they get started and how did their strategies change as they struggled to get more successful in the marketplace? What were the important changes or events or supporting factors that eventually enabled and led to their success growth and other market segments? How did they handle competitive organizations from a market and an intellectual property point of view? In general try to identify the critical factors to which you attribute their success and see if there any commonalities that you can learn from?

She is a single parent and has a job working for Food Basics on Pine Street in Sault Ste. Marie. She is a unionized employee and works the late afternoon and evening shift. There are three children in the family. The children are Celeste (age 17) Benjamin (age15) and Celina (age 6). Novella has a two- bedroom apartment with Pine Allard Properties. Celeste and Benjamin have been attending St. Mary's College and Celina attends the St. Paul Catholic School. Novella was married to a Jamaican Canadian man Jeremias Johnson and they resided in Toronto in the Jane and Finch area. Both Novella and Jeremias immigrated from Jamaica in their late teens settling in Toronto and became Canadian citizens. They met each other in Toronto being introduced at a family gathering. Jeremias had a job working in a factory and Novella worked at a local grocery store. They were a devout Christian couple and attended the House of Praise Tabernacle in Toronto. Attempting to raise the children with Christian values they decided to send their children to the Roman Catholic educational system. Jeremias was tragically killed in a drive by shooting. Novella was concerned about raising the children in the Jane and Finch area. Novella's sister Auntie Tasha had been attending Sault College Esthetician Diploma Program and encourage Novella to move the family to Sault Ste. Marie. When first arriving in Sault Ste. Marie Novella and the children lived with Auntie Tasha in a crowded Pine Allard apartment. Eventually there was an opening for a two-bedroom apartment in the same building and Novella moved herself and the children into the two-bedroom apartment.

Denique reports to their teachers that there is conflict at home with Novella. Denique says that Novella is trans phobic and refuses to acknowledge their transgender identity. Denique states that trans phobia attitudes are supported at the Elim Pentecostal Church reporting that the head Pastor has stated that Denique is possessed by a demon.ù Denique reports that they refuse to go to church and their refusal to attend church has also being creating conflict with Novella. Denique has also been subject to ongoing bullying at school and has been repeatedly beaten up by older white boys in the school. The Principal is unsupportive of transgender students and believes that the fault lies with inadequate parenting. That is the Principal has stated that is there is not a dominant male figure in these families.ù The Principal has intimated that CAS should be called to investigate what has been going on in the Johnson family and has stated the he has concerns that the children have experienced neglect due to Novella's work schedule.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/21/bsl202-workplace-lawliaising/,Question 1 (25 marks) Lorraine has just graduated from a Bachelor or Arts majoring in Art History. She has a specialisation in 15th century Italian artwork. It has been quite tricky for Lorraine to find gainful employment in her area. Graduate positions that specialise in 15th century Italian artwork are few and far-between. Given this Lorraine is very excited to see an advertisement on Art-WORK.com a popular website for art-related job advertisements. The advertisement is for an entry-level position working as an assistant to John Bochetto the director of art at Little Florence Art Gallery. The advertisement says the following: Amazing opportunity to work with one of the most esteemed Italian art experts. As assistant to the director of art John Bochetto you will have the opportunity to travel study and develop your career. Training will be provided and you will work side-by-side with specialists in the area and will work directly with the Faccini collection in the coming months. Apply now!ù Lorraine applies and is very happy to receive an interview. At the interview she meets with a representative from HR Rhey and a junior art advisor Billings. In the interview both Rhey and Billings explain what the job will be like. Billings says that all new employees are given training to work at the gallery and are funded a trip to Florence in order to further develop their specialisations. Rhey tells Lorraine that she will love working with John Bochetto because he is very dedicated to his prot©g©s and ensures that they are immersed in the artwork and the environment. Billings agrees with this. Without reservation Lorraine takes the job and signs a very simple employment contract that states hours of work remuneration and entitlement to vacations etc. She starts work the next day. She is surprised but pleased to find that one of her fellow graduates Henry is starting on the same day as her and in the same position. They went to university together and worked as partners on multiple occasions. The first big event of the day is meeting John Bochetto. While John is polite but aloof to Lorraine John is quite friendly to Henry. Within the first two hours of the day Lorraine is shown to a desk and given a mountain of paperwork to tackle. Henry on the other hand spends the entire day with John inspecting various pieces of art. This pattern continues for six months. Lorraine finds she is given administrative duties only and Henry has been given four opportunities to attend gallery shows with John has been given training on how to discuss various artwork with clients and has been promised a study trip to Florence within the next three months. Further to this Lorraine receives an email from HR stating that because she has less experience than Henry she will need to take a refresher course within the next six months. Lorraine is aghast. She was told there would be study opportunities in this position but going back to study what she already knows is not what she had in mind and her and Henry had the exact same qualifications coming into the position. Further she has not been allowed in the same room as the Faccini collection due to its preciousness and fragility. Lorraine decides to approach Rhey from HR and John to discuss these issues. Rhey is very quiet but John explains why this is happening. He says that he has a firm belief that 15th century Italian artwork is very inappropriate for young females due to the high level of nudity in the artwork. Because of this he does not see fit that she is given the same position as Henry in terms of direct contact and discussion of artwork. Further he explains in regard to the Faccini collection that only art associates aged over 50 years of age are allowed to work with the original pieces as they are the only ones that have enough experience. Lorraine is very upset. After reading the advertisement and attending the interview she thought she had a pretty good idea of what the position would be like. Lorraine comes to you for advice on the following: a) Whether Lorraine is able to rely on what was advertised by Little Florence Art Gallery and what was said in the interview  consider this under both common law and statute. (15 marks) b) Whether Lorraine is able to bring a discrimination claim against either John Little Florence Art Gallery or both. (10 marks) Question 2 (15 marks) Trey is a senior art executive at Little Florence Art Gallery. He has worked at the gallery for 15 years and started as a junior intern and slowly made his way to being a senior art executive in charge of the department of 14th century Italian art. He has been a senior executive for the last 6 years. He has recently found out that the gallery has decided to restructure. The restructure proposes to amalgamate the departments of the 10th to 15th centuries of Italian art into one department. The director of the department will be John Bochetto and John will also be the only senior executive in the department. All the other executives will become art associates. For Trey this would mean a downgrade in his position. An associate is generally for someone who has work between 5-10 years at a gallery while Trey has worked 15. Further the pay is lower and the hours are longer. The work is also different. Rather than liaising and communicating with òbig' clients Trey will now be dealing with public gallery viewings and general inquiries. Trey will also now have to answer to John as his supervisor in the gallery when they have been in equal positions for the last five years. The gallery has offered Trey this new position under the restructure and given all the considerations Trey has decided not to accept the position. As a result of this Little Florence Art Gallery has fired Trey. Trey comes to you for advice. Advise Trey.    Read less,BSL202 Workplace Law|Liaising

What response would you make to the following statement made by a parent talking to you about their child? Discuss briefly how you know your response is therapeutic. I wish he would just do as he was told!ù 8. Briefly discuss two factors that would be important for a C.Y.C. to consider when helping a family with child management. 9. Regardless of the setting or the age and stage of a child/youth what are the steps to intervention? Discuss each step briefly. List six.. 10. C.Y.C.'s often support families in their homes instead of making families come into an office environment. Name four specific advantages to being with people where they live their lives or online.  11. List four ways you would positively involve parents in a contemporary residential treatment program.  12. When we work with families we need to be aware of the impact of larger systems on the family particularly in terms of risk factors. From your readings and discussions in class list four potential systemic risk factors that could be barriers to parents nurturing their children. A. You are a home-based worker meeting the parents in their home for the very first time. The children are not involved in this initial meeting. The family consists of both parents (married for 11 years) and two children. Parents describe their daughter as a quiet compliant ten-year-old girl who is a bit on the shy side but has two really good friends. They are really concerned about their eight-year-old son who they describe as a hellionù. He is a handfulù at home but acts like an angel  at school. Parents are very frustrated with their son's inability to follow the rules and routines at home. He just doesn't listen. Mom explains in great detail all of the things she has tried to use as consequences with her son such as grounding taking away privileges early bedtimes. She is very clear with the worker that none of the techniques she has tried work. Their son will not listen to them and is defiant. The Father raises his voice when talking about his son whom he says ignores his attempts to teach him the properù way. The only thing the boy seems to understand is a good swat.ù 13. If you were this worker what would your initial assessment of the situation be based on what you have heard from parents? 14. How would you describe the interactional pattern between the son and the parents that could be contributing to the son's behaviour?  15. Using a strength-based approach what would your initial steps be with this family?  16. How might you explain to the parents what you think is going on?  17. Based on your answer to the question above What would you suggest to parents that could break their negative interactional pattern with their son?  B. You work in a residential treatment program. You have a withdrawn usually quiet fourteen year old male adolescent who is very small for his age. His name is Jared. You have noticed that his size and quiet nature seem to be targeted by the other boys in the home and he is often picked on by the other residents. Jared is in residential treatment because he gets angry and has major tantrums that typically end in restraints by staff. The staff try to manage his acting out behaviour with consequences. You have observed that the more Jared gets consequence the more he withdraws from others.  You have accompanied Jared to his home to facilitate positive connections and visits with his parents and you have noticed a similar pattern. The Dad  Mom and older brother all connect with one another by teasing and mild put-downs. Whenever the Dad or the big brother tease Jared he gets angry and the temper tantrums start. His tantrums overwhelm his family and invite them to get angry back. His parents feel they are unable to help their son with his terrible temper.  18. Use preparatory empathy to try to determine how Jared might be seeing his situation and how he might be feeling. Discuss.  19. Based on your answers in the question above develop a hypothesis regarding Jared's temper tantrums. 20. Following the steps to intervention what would you do to help Jared? 21. As the adolescent's primary worker briefly describe two skill promotion areas you would focus on and explain why.    C. You are running a parent group where you are talking to parents about the importance of having empathy with their children so that they also develop empathy. One of your parents says the following: I think I am an empathic parent with my two daughters. They are eleven and fourteen years old. Yet I think they take advantage of my empathy. For example the other night my eleven year old wanted to stay up past her bedtime to watch television. I told her I knew how she felt that it was past her bedtime and she couldn't watch TV. She said if I really knew how she felt I would let her watch. She also said that all of her friends were watching the show. I ended up feeling sorry for her and let her watch the program. So much for empathy! What else could I have done?ù 22. What mistakeù do you think this parent is making? What would you say to this parent?

Aliah has suffered from depression since the loss of her parents ten years ago. She has also been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and she experiences distressing flashbacks to her parent's death. She attempted suicide by overdose some years ago (this led to a short medical admission and an admission to an acute psychiatric unit for stabilisation of her mental state and mitigation of risk). When Aliah feels low her sleep is often limited to 5- 6 hours per night and her appetite is poor. She has been taking ant-depressant medications for the past six years and Khalid states her GP also referred her to a psychologist who specialises in trauma. She has attended several sessions but stopped going about three months ago after the 10th anniversary of her parent's death. Khalid tells staff on admission that she does not talk to him much anymoreù (relationship was good until three months ago).

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/21/inte2412-governance-and-change-in-digital-business-2/,IT Governance for Emerging Digital Technologies This individual assessment requires you to further apply the governance and change management theories concepts and frameworks introduced in the course. You will have to offer a proposal aimed at avoiding governance shortcomings in contemporary major IT projects and operations. Your proposed solution needs to strengthen IT governance to accommodate new challenges specifically in public sector and governmental organizations. You are therefore tasked with providing advice on how a particular Australian state government should prepare to deal with governance of emerging and wide-spreading AI systems that will be harnessed in government departments. In offering your advice for such new technologies and future IT projects in a business report you are also asked to provide guidance of how to deal with the issues of managing cognitive bias in the development of governance practice for such novel digital technologies. In recent years the Victorian Government has sought to strengthen governance involving ICT investments. One of its initiatives has involved the creation of an ICT dashboard. This database seeks to plot the progress of current ICT projects in government departments. See the Victorian Government IT Dashboard (Links to an external site.). While this initiative has seen some improvement in the public accountability of projects there is still concern about project performance as measured by timely completions and costly overruns. Several Public Service Board Commissioners however are concerned about whether or not the dashboard system offers a fit for purpose governance system for ICT. The Commissioners in their deliberations have been influenced by recent discussions about the impact of cognitive bias on decision-making. For instance they have come across several informative articles in the business press. Victoria has sought to enhance its project management involving ICT by publishing several guidelines (Links to an external site.). On inspection however the Commissioners have noticed that much of the advice offered appears to dwell on standard project management processes. Insufficient focus seems to center on the realities of decision-making behaviour in organizations. Likewise scant consideration seems to be given to knowing-doing gaps that can frustrate effective governance. As a consequence the Commissioners are now interested in receiving advice about how such project ventures might be better managed thus improving success rates and lowering public expenditures. In their discussions the Public Service Board Commissioners also have started to become worried about the governance processes involving AI applications that are likely to be implemented in the near future. In the past the state's management of conventional ICT has been problematic and often lagging in effective execution. Two recent articles in Forbes have tweaked their attention. In turn a current interview between two governance experts published in YouTube has heightened the Commissioners' interest. (Links to an external site.) The Commissioners are keen to adopt a more proactive stance when it comes to dealing with important emerging technologies that will be harnessed in government departments. Again the Commissioners want to receive advice on how the state should prepare to deal with governance of AI systems.     Read less,INTE2412 Governance and Change in Digital Business

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/22/bafi1008-business-finance-company-selection-and-share-analysis/,This assignment will require you to analyse a firm of your choice from various perspectives. The assignment will cover the topics bond valuation share valuation cost of capital market efficiency and more.  You will analyse a firm of your choice from various perspectives. Each part of the assignment relates to a Business Finance topic covered in a different study week. In order to write a high-quality report you will need to work on this assignment throughout the semester and focus on each of the different parts of the assignment during the relevant teaching week. Your task in the first part of the assignment is to select a publicly traded company listed in either Australia or in the U.S. You will perform various analyses on this company during this semester. In order to be able to complete these analyses there is a number of selection criteria for your company: The company has outstanding bonds as well as shares. The company's shares have been paying dividends for at least 5 years.  Information on listed companies and their outstanding securities is available on public investing websites such as investing.com or Yahoo Finance. To find out whether a company that you are interested in has bonds outstanding type the name of your company in the search bar on investing.com and a dropdown menu will appear showing all outstanding securities of this firm (there should be shares as well as bonds). To find out whether a company you are interested in has been paying dividends select the stock of your company on Yahoo Finance and go to Historical Data and select Show: Dividends Only. (Hint: firms that both pay dividends and have bonds outstanding are often mature well-established firms)  Once you have found a company of your interest that fulfils all selection criteria provide an overview of the company details listing your company's name name of the stock exchange on which the firm's stock is listed its ticker symbol and a list of a maximum of five of the firm's outstanding bonds including coupon rates and maturity dates. This page will also be the front page of your assignment so make sure it looks attractive and professional. Feel free to add additional information which you think is relevant for investors in the company's shares and bonds. Write a brief report describing the company's financial situation and the major opportunities and challenges in the coming years. Your analysis should be based on at least 3 reputable business publications (which are NOT publications of the company itself). One place to find the company's financial statements is investing.com (select your company and click on Financials). The topic of this part of the assignment is covered in Week 3. In this part of the assignment you will analyse one of the firm's outstanding bonds. Firstly compute the credit spread of this bond by comparing the yield-to-maturity on this bond with the yield on Treasury Bonds of comparable duration. (For information on current US treasury yields go to Yahoo Finance and type treasury yieldù. For AUS yields see the RBA website and look for Capital Market Yields  Government Bonds  Monthlyù). Secondly estimate the bond's price one year from now (assuming that interest rates remain constant) and comment on the reason behind the expected price change (if any) from the current price of the bond. Finally provide a credit rating for the firm's bonds based on your analysis of the company bond as well as your analysis in Part B of the assignment and explain why you have given this rating. The topic of this part of the assignment is covered in Week 4. In this part of the assignment you will analyse your company's shares. Firstly provide a graph and comment on the company's stock price changes in the previous three years. Explain what factors have caused the stock price to develop as it did and link this investigation to your analysis in Part B of the assignment. Secondly provide an overview of the firm's dividend payments during the previous 5 years. If your company paid dividends more than once a year sum up all dividends to find the total yearly dividend. Using the dividend discount model estimate the return that investors currently require for holding your company's stock. You can assume that the firm's dividends will continue to grow indefinitely at the same rate as the average dividend growth rate in the previous five years or you can make alternative assumptions on the future dividend payments as you see fit. The topic of this part of the assignment is covered in Week 9. In this part of the assignment you will investigate the efficiency of the market in which your company is listed. You will do an event study and investigate your company's stock price around a recent earnings announcement of the company. Firstly you will have to identify a date on which your company has done an earnings announcement. Go to Yahoo Finance and type earnings calendarù and then type your company's ticker code in the separate search bar. The announcement date is termed day 0. Next download the daily stock prices of your company during the period around the earnings announcement date and plot a graph of the stock price from trading day -5 to trading day 5. Trading days are all days during which the stock exchange is open. In event studies we ignore weekends which means for example that if the announcement day (day 0) is a Monday then (day -1) is going to be the previous Friday. Write a short essay to address the following questions. What is the efficient market hypothesis? If the market is efficient what is the expected stock price reaction to an earnings announcement before day 0 on day 0 and after day 0? Look at the stock price of your company is the market efficient? The topic of this part of the assignment is covered in Week 10. In this part of the assignment you will have to estimate your company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC).    Read less,BAFI1008 Business Finance- Company Selection and Share Analysis

Reliability is difficult to demonstrate due to the small scale of the study. This is a known aspect of qualitative studies due to the small data size. Reliability in this study will be supported by the standardised questionnaires which could be used across different cohorts should there be subsequent studies. The trustworthiness of the study can be assessed through the credibility dependability conformability transferability and authenticity of the research (Elo et al 2014). The data collection method selected for the study has a significant impact on the credibility. Data analysis and reporting I will conduct a thematic analysis of the results to seek insights from this research. Through my thematic analysis I will seek to identify patterns or themes from the results of the data collection for this research (Maguire & Delahunt 2017). In conducting this analysis I will be following the six-phase guide from Braun and Clark (2013): 1. Become familiar with the data 2. Generate initial codes 3. Search for themes 4. Review themes 5. Define themes 6. Write-up. Results from the questionaries will be analysed and the experimental group and control group responses will be compared along with the experimental group initial questionaries being compared to the final questionnaire for the group. This data will give an indication of the teacher and student perceptions of differentiated assessment compared to test-based assessments. In addition assessment results will be analysed for both the experimental and control groups to determine if in the context of this study differentiated assessment had a positive neutral or negative impact on student assessment outcomes. Results will be evaluated to determine if individual students did better or worse on assessments where differentiated assessment options are provided. The experimental group will be compared to the control group to determine typical levels of assessment results variance.    Read less,GEOG5010 Research Methods and Experimental Group

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/22/200585-organizational-behaviour-creativity-and-innovation/,Whilst completing PIA (Individual) I felt a bit disappointed in myself for not having the courage to take risks to find creative solutions to problems. This reminded me of the various lost opportunities due to being riskaverse. I also felt anxious because I recognised that I have a lot of work to do in terms of self-improvement. However by the end of the PIA I realised that I could change and felt motivated to do so. was pleased with myself whilst doing the PIA (Group) because it validated the fact that I am good at working with others and can effectively lead a team. It allowed me to reflect on positive group experiences in which I set objectives and ensured commitment to group goals. I also felt frustrated because I realised that I tend to focus more on results and fail to facilitate strong group relationships. This encouraged me to think of ways to change my perspective and the way I work in teams in future. Whilst doing the stress management assessment I was quite surprised because I realised that I am not as effective in balancing my personal and professional responsibilities. I was also annoyed at myself for continuing to do things in the same routine and managing my time inefficiently. By the end I recognised that I had to make serious changes and was determined to prioritise my physical and mental wellbeing. PIA (Individual) aimed to determine how well individuals solve problems and adopt creative approaches when appropriate. (Pearson PIA-survey: problem solving creativity and innovation). While it helped determine whether you have high normal or low ability to engage in situation-appropriate problem solving and recommended strategies that can be adopted to improve problem-solving ability it did not provide sufficient information on what causes individuals to adopt certain problem-solving approaches (analytical or creative). Hence it prevented one from gaining a deeper insight into their behaviour. Overall the PIA met its objectives because I was able to establish that I have a low-ability to engage in situation-appropriate problem solving and am highly risk-averse which impacts my ability to participate in creative problem-solving. PIA (Group) intended to provide insights into how proficiently one leads a team is an effective team member and diagnoses and facilitates team development (Pearson PIA-survey: team development behaviours). It also enables individuals to see whether they have high normal or low ability to develop high performing teams and provides extensive knowledge on the three facets (previously mentioned) of team development behaviours. However it does not show how they are related or recommend strategies one could employ to enhance their ability to develop high-performing teams. Nonetheless the PIA met its objectives because I was able to establish that I have increased my ability to develop effective teams but I am task-oriented and need to work on building stronger team relationships. PIA (Organisation) aimed to determine how effectively individuals utilise the three tools for stress management; eliminating stressors developing resiliency and coping strategies (Pearson PIA-survey: stress management assessment). While it helped establish whether you have a high normal or low ability to effectively process stress and provided detailed descriptions about the three tools. It failed to recommend strategies individuals could employ to enhance their ability to cope with stressful situations. Regardless the PIA met its objectives as it allowed me to determine that I have a low ability to process stress; I am a workaholic and I need to practice effective time management and relaxation techniques.

Systems thinking helps us to understand the elements and relationships/interconnectedness of parts to a system. Currently the use of systems thinking is being advocated in public health as a new paradigm shift. It aids in the solving of complex and intractable public health problems and the identification of risk factors for the achievement of health systems goals/good population health outcomes. You are required to thoroughly research and write a critical individual report on systems thinking and its application to strengthening the six building blocks of health systems for the reduction/prevention of a chosen public health problem/issue for a selected country. 1. Identify a country (e.g. Australia or any other country) and a public health issue. Public health problems/issues include excessive alcohol consumption food safety heart disease and stroke road traffic accidents nutrition physical activity and obesity tobacco use water sanitation and hygiene HIV drug abuse and mental health.  2. Provide a critical analysis of the concept of systems thinking and how it can be applied to public health. 3. Discuss the six health systems building blocks as proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). 4.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/25/mgt3rpm-remuneration-and-performance-management-3/,You are an HR professional helping to design a remuneration management program for one of the following scenarios. Scenario 1: Erich's Roofing the eleventh largest roofing company in the world is experiencing turnover problems with the employees who install roofs (i.e. the roofers). The General Manager has asked you to fix the problem. While your primary emphasis might be on having a competitive base pay you need to decide if there is anything you can do in terms of incentives. Scenario 2: World's Best Tool Coating Company is a high-tech firm specializing in the coating of cutting tools (e.g. drill bits cutting blades). These coatings lengthen the time before a tool needs to be re-sharpened. The company is concerned that its competition continues to develop new coating methods as well as new applications for the coating. It has asked you to help them develop a remuneration plan to create a work environment where its employees come up with more innovations and suggestions on where its coatings might be applied. Scenario 3: Jane Humphries Associates (JHA) is a relatively small advertising firm in Melbourne. They recently shifted their strategic plan to focus almost exclusively on big clients who generate $200000 or more annually in revenue for the firm. There are six employees in the firm who focus exclusively on business development identifying new client prospects and making pitchesù to these prospects about ways that JHA can help them. While the payout for landing these prospects is high averaging four times the revenue of the typical JHA client in the past the likelihood of getting these new clients is considerably lower. In the past the Development associates (as they are called) were paid heavily on incentive pay (4 percent of revenue generated by clients landed by the associate) along with a base pay that was 95 percent of the market rate for comparable jobs in Melbourne. It has asked you to advise them on how its remuneration plan might be changed to reflect the changes introduced in its new strategic plan. Task Based on the topics covered this semester write a report on the design of an appropriate remuneration management program for one of the scenarios listed above.

Aspart of this intervention the organization would like to include a mobile application that can be used to monitor a health behaviour. As a health behaviour expert you have been brought on to the team to evaluate two existing applications and provide recommendations regarding which application the organization should use. You must specify the NPO (you can make up a name) and describe in one sentence or less their remit in terms of target audience and context. For example òRRQ-WA' who target rural and remote Queensland adults (aged 18-65 years) or the òUQ Welcome Department' who target first year students from The University of Queensland. You are to complete a review that compares and contrasts two mobile apps (Android or Apple). The chosen apps should be designed to monitor a chosen health behaviour for a target population  choose the same behaviour for both apps. You may choose apps that target a behaviour from the list below: ¢ Physical activity ¢ Sedentary behaviour ¢ A specific dietary behaviour ¢ Dental flossing ¢ Alcohol use ¢ A regular sleep schedule You may choose the same health behaviour as other assessment in PUBH2004. If you would like to choose another health behaviour than on the list please check with the course coordinator. If you do not have a mobile phone or one with necessary capabilities please contact the course coordinator by email as soon as possible. You are required to download at least one app by the end of week 2. The app must be a tool to monitor the health behaviour on at least a weekly basis and information can either be entered manually (e.g. you record the number and type of drinks/ day) or it may be recorded automatically (e.g. the app links to a maps function and records distance walked/ run). You can choose to operate both apps concurrently or engage with one app from week 2-6 and the second app from week 7 onwards.  Your review must include the following: ¢ Provide a brief definition and rationale for the target health behaviour and target population ¢ Reflect on the process of monitoring health behaviour overall including user experience We recommend that you keep a weekly or fortnightly diary so that you have something to refer back to. In the first tutorial (week 2) we will cover what you might want to include. ¢ Appraise both apps in terms of their strengths and weaknesses as a tool for measuring health behaviour comparing and contrasting the apps. You should specify your rationale for the measurement e.g. to help assess prevalence of the behaviour (single sentence). ¢ Use research to justify the key points of comparison. You might consider research with other measures of the health behaviour with known reliability or validity to help identify strengths and weaknesses ¢ Provide a summary and argue for a recommendation about the use of the apps    Read less,PUBH2004 Understanding Health Behaviours : Monitor a Health Behaviour

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/26/act301-accounting-theory-and-contemporary-issues/,1. Because accounting standard-setters throughout the world typically consider the potential economic and social consequences of the accounting standards they develop it has been argued that reports developed in accordance with the accounting standards cannot be considered neutral or unbiased. Do you agree with this perspective? Is this perspective consistent with the qualitative attributes typically promoted in accounting conceptual framework projects?  2. The website of the FASB (www.fasb.org ) has a section entitled òFacts about PASS' in which there is information about how accounting standards are developed (as accessed in late 2013). In part it states: Mission The mission of the FASB is to establish and improve standards of financial accounting and reporting that foster financial reporting by nongovernmental entities that provides decision-useful information to investors and other users of financial reports. That mission is accomplished through a comprehensive and independent process that encourages broad participation objectively considers all stakeholder views and is subject to oversight by the Financial Accounting Foundation's Board of Trustees. Standards-Setting Process The FASB accomplishes its mission through a comprehensive and independent process that encourages broad participation objectively considers all stakeholder views and is subject to oversight by the Financial Accounting Foundation's Board of Trustees. The Rules of Procedure describe the FASB's operating procedures including the due process activities that are to be open to public participation or observation to provide transparency into the standards-setting process. In particular the Rules of Procedure describe:  The organization in which the FASB operates The FASB mission how the mission is accomplished and related principles that guide the Board's standards-setting activities. The operating procedures of the FASB including the responsibilities of the Chairman the composition of the FASB technical staff the role of advisory groups including the Emerging Issues Task Force and the role of public forums in our due process. Our various forms of communications including the form and content of Accounting Standards Updates Exposure Drafts and Concepts Statements. Protocols for meetings of the FASB and voting requirements. Rules governing public announcements and the kinds of information made broadly available to the public. A high-level overview of the standards-setting process as established by the Rules of Procedure follows. The nature and extent of the Board's specific research and outreach activities will vary from project to project depending on the nature and scope of the reporting issues involved. 1. The Board identifies a financial reporting issue based on requests/recommendations from stakeholders or through other means.  2. The FASB Chairman decides whether to add a project to the technical agenda after consultation with FASB Members and others as appropriate and subject to oversight by the Foundation's Board of Trustees.  3. The Board deliberates at one or more public meetings the various reporting issues identified and analyzed by the staff.  4. The Board issues an Exposure Draft to solicit broad stakeholder input. (In some projects the Board may issue a Discussion Paper to obtain input in the early stages of a project.)  5. The Board holds a public roundtable meeting on the Exposure Draft if necessary.  6. The staff analyses comment letters public roundtable discussion and any other information obtained through due process activities. The Board redeliberates the proposed provisions carefully considering the stakeholder input received at one or more public meetings.  7. The Board issues an Accounting Standards Update describing amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification. Given the process involved in developing accounting standards which involves asking constituents to make submissions on exposure drafts do you think that accounting standards developed within the United States would be the same as accounting standards developed in another country?

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/26/analyses-of-the-financial-risks/,Your team has just been hired by Origin Energy Ltd to advice the company's capital budgeting division. Origin Energy is an Australian publicly listed energy company with headquarters in Sydney. The company operates 12 power stations in Australia which can jointly generate up to 6010 MW of electricity representing about 13 per cent of the total power generation capacity in the Australian market. Origin mainly operates coal and gas power plants besides a hydroelectric plant and a small solar park. Currently the company is considering building a new coal-fired power station. For that purpose they are looking at a site in Western Australia.  From your team they are seeking advice on the financial feasibility of this project and also on the financial risks involved. Over the last two years Origin Energy has already spent $100 million on R&D for the newly proposed power plant. If the company would decide to actually go ahead with the project the new power plant given its projected size would account for a 20% increase in assets of the company. In other words for capital budgeting purposes it would be reasonable to assume that the initial investment in the plant would be equal to about 20% of the company's current gross property plant and equipment (PPE). The new plant is expected to be in use for 10 years. The economists at Origin are expecting that after that 10-year period renewable energy will be cheap enough to outcompete electricity generated by coal plants. At that point the plant will be retired. The expectation is that at the end of the project the plant can be sold at a residual value of only 5% of its original cost. The company would borrow $500 million to (partly) finance this investment at an interest rate equal to the average cost of debt of the company. The plant is projected to have a capacity of 1200 MW of electricity per year which will increase the yearly revenues of the company by about 23% compared to total revenues in the financial year ending in June 2020. The revenues of this new project are expected to stay at BUSINESS FINANCE that same level during the first 5 running years of the plant. From then onwards the company is projecting that renewables will put increasing pressure on the electricity prices and this will have a dampening effect on the revenues of the new plant. The expectation is that after year 5 the revenues of the plant will be gradually decreasing by about 10% per year.  Your team will have to determine the rest of the cash flows associated with this proposed project. The CFO of the company has indicated that it would be reasonable to expect that the operating costs of the new plant will be of similar proportion relative to the revenues as Origin's other plants. The new project would require an additional NWC of about 25% of the first-year revenues of the project. Depreciation of the new plant should be done in a straight-line over the full life of the project to a value of 0. The CFO of Origin advices to compute the cost of debt by computing the yield-to-maturity on the company's bonds and the cost of equity of the company using the CAPM. Importantly the management of the company has asked your team to consider the risk that Australia will adopt a carbon emission tax in the future depending on the outcome of the next federal elections. Due to increasing concerns about global warming and international pressure on governments to act on it there is a possibility that such a tax on carbon emission will be adapted and that would have an adverse effect on the cash flows of the new coal plant. Origin estimates that if such a tax is implemented this will mean a charge of about $150 per tonne of CO2 emission which comes down to an additional cost for the company of about $330000 for every MW of coal-produced electricity. Origin has requested your team to present two cash flow scenarios for the new plant   Scenario 1: Australia does not adopt a carbon tax; Scenario 2: Australia adopts a carbon tax two years after the start of the project.  Report The results of your analyses will have to be presented in a business report to Origin's executive management team. The report should provide clear advice on whether or not the company should go ahead with the projected power plant. The advice of your team should be (partly) based on your estimations of the NPV and the IRR of the proposed project under the two different possible scenarios. Remember members of the executive management team often do not have a finance background so your results will have to be supported by clear tables which show the calculation of the free cash flows; clear explanations of how the free cash flows were computed and what choices were made in these computations and why. The final advice of your team should also be (partly) based on your analyses of the financial risks involved with the project. Therefore the report should include a number of additional analyses: a) a discussion on the financial situation of Origin Energy based on your analysis of the current financial statements of the company. This section will have to explain how the proposed project would affect the financial situation of the company. b) a comprehensive discussion on recent insights in the energy market from (at least  3) reputable and credible business finance articles. This discussion should also include an estimate of the amount of systemic risk in stocks of energy companies which can be assessed by investigating Origin's shares and those of two of its competitors in the energy market.  BUSINESS FINANCE c) Finally the report should include an informed discussion on carbon taxation (again based on research by at least 3 reputable sources). Explain to the management of the company through what channels the pricing of carbon emission could potentially change the behaviour of companies in the future. In this discussion provide an example of a country where such a tax has been implemented and to what extend it is effective. Also provide information on alternative forms of regulation that the Australian government could be implementing instead of a carbon tax in order to prevent actions by businesses that are harmful for the climate. Are these alternative types of regulation affecting company behaviour trough financial incentives? Or through other means? The report should be about 12 pages long (excluding cover page table of content introduction reference list appendices etc.).

This case study asks whether the average Australian should consider pursuing a university degreeor is tertiary study an unsound investment of a person's money and time? Background and outline of case study question: Traditionally the role of universities was to create and disperse knowledge. Universities prepare people for professional careers (law medicine teaching etc.) in today's democratic pluralistic society while developing their personalities morals and outlooks. A university degree became seen as a prerequisite to a well-paid job as traditional industries such as manufacturing declined in Australia and work became increasingly centred around the òknowledge economy' where information was gathered analysed and applied. However for many people the decision to pursue a university degree is not a straightforward one. There are many costs involved not just in explicit costs but also what are known as òopportunity costs'  the money that they could have been making had they not been studying. There are also many risks. A degree does not guarantee a job to the extent it once did let alone a well-paid one. Additionally there is now student debt to pay off at a lower threshold than it once was. It is a complex issue.    Read less,ACCO001 Academic Communication and Knowledge Economy

In lesson 1 we talk about the role HR plays within today's organizations. It's logical is it not? Today the most valuable asset a company can have is its employees! Years ago while pursuing our MBAs we took courses in Inventory Management Production and Plant Operations. But then twenty years ago our economy was based upon manufacturing and a company's production capacity and inventory were of prime importance. Today we're in the information age and employees especially creative employees with innovative ideas and technological skills are paramount. Twenty years ago an HRM was little more than an administrator someone to process the application form and ensure the new employee's beneficiary form was completed correctly. Today HRMs are strategic partners in every thriving business enterprise developing policies and programs to support the mission of the business enterprise. In your own words discuss what it means to be a strategic business partner. Why is it important for the HR strategy to be aligned with the business strategy? What skills are important for HR managers to have to be able to effectively add strategic value to the organization? Don't forget to read over and then respond to a colleague's ideas. Be sure to include citations from at least two sources you used to develop your responses!  Thoughts about HR Functions in today's world The field of human resource management has changed significantly over the past several decades. Make note of the HR functions identified in the presentations and readings and reflect carefully on the responsibilities of today's HRMs. From the learning materials as well as your own observations and/or experience (if applicable) please describe how the human resource function has changed over the last decade or so. Do you anticipate any further changes to the human resource management role in the near or distant future? If so please explain your rationale.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/27/sitxwhs002-managementhazard/,Question 1 (10 marks) Suppose the file reference label Purchase refers to raw data file PurchaseRecords.txt (not provided) in SAS Studio. PurchaseRecords.txt contains each customer's purchase records in the form of one record per customer. For each record each pair of fields is separated by a comma and the fields are arranged in the following order: customer's identity (at most 10 characters no embedded blank) number of visits made by the customer (standard numeric) and a units-purchased field for each visit (standard numeric). The exact number of units-purchased fields depends on the number of visits made by the customer. An empty units-purchased field indicates the customer did not make any purchase in the respective visit. For example customer C23005A6 made 3 visits and purchased 15 and 39 units in the first and third visits. There is no missing value for the customer's identity and number of visits fields and there is no shortage of fields in each record. A few records in PurchaseRecords.txt are shown in the table below for your reference. You are asked to accomplish all of the following tasks within the same DATA step. Using any other procedures are not allowed. The tasks are: Create a SAS data set named ItemPurchased. Reside the created data set in the library Mywork of SAS studio. You may assume the Mywork library has already been defined in SAS Studio. Read the records in PurchaseRecords.txt into SAS to create an observation for each visit with purchases only. For example create only two observations for customer C23005A6 because the customer made only two purchases out of 3 visits. The data set ItemPurchased must contains only two variables namely customer's identity (character type in at least length of 10) and the number of units purchased by the customer in a visit (standard numeric type).

They have four children: Zayne 16 Lina 12 and 6-year-old twin boys Kadir and Ahad. Adnan is employed as a bus driver and required to works shifts. He smokes approximately 20 cigarettes a day and has a BMI of 31.  The family live in a three bedroomed terraced house in the West End of Newcastle where there is a high Asian population. Adnan's father Ali has recently come to live with them following the death of his wife. Ali has COPD and is in the early stages of dementia. Because of the limited number of bedrooms in the home they had their dining room converted into a bedroom for Ali. Adnan has found the cramped living at home quite stressful especially when he has been working late into the night and feels tired.  He has also been worried about his father's deteriorating health. One week ago when Adnan was due to finish his shift at 10pm he had arrived back into the depot unexpectedly at 6pm explaining to the supervisor that he had a very severe headache and felt he was unable to focus his eyesight properly to drive the bus safely. The supervisor noticed straight away that Adnan's face appeared asymmetrical and although he was clearly trying to tell her something his speech was slurred and she couldn't really understand what he was trying to say. He also appeared unsteady on his feet. She immediately guided him to a seat and called 999.  The paramedics arrived and confirmed the supervisor's concerns that he may have suffered a Stroke. They took him to the accident and emergency department at the RVI. Here the diagnosis of a stroke was confirmed and Adnan was admitted to the stroke unit for treatment and nursing care.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/28/fin-420-mutual-fund-due-diligence-assignment-2/,Step 1: Download this Excel Download Excel template (Attatched). Step 2: Navigate to www.sec.gov. Select the Filingsù dropdown menu and the option for Company Filing Searchù. Step 3: Using the search box in the middle of the page type in the ticker symbol for the company in question. Your first company is Proctor & Gamble and the ticker symbol is PG. After you type in the ticker select your company from the drop-down list that appears. (Do not type PG and then press enter. Wait for the dropdown list to load.) When the search result loads a page that says EDGAR: Company Search Resultsù then you need to select Classic Versionù in the upper right corner. At this point you should see a series of rows with company filings listed with the most recent filings at the top. You will see in Row 1 on the template which annual reports (10-Ks) you need to find. Locate your first 10-K and select the blue oval that says Interactive Dataù. Once the new page loads just below the company's name in the upper left corner you will see a link that says View Excel Documentù. Click this link and you will download the full 10-K which includes the Balance Sheet the Income Statement and the Statement of Cash Flows. At this point you should just be gathering data. Download all spreadsheets needed first. See Row 1 on the Excel template. Wait to use the data until the next section on these instructions. Step 4: Repeat step 3 to gather all needed information for Proctor & Gamble. In Row 1 on the provided template you will see all the 10-Ks that you need to gather. Step 5: Repeat step 3 to gather all needed information on your second company which is Colgate Palmolive (ticker: CL). Your third company under analysis is Clorox (ticker: CLX). I have provided you with the information that you need for CLX so that you can see how this process is done. Using the Downloaded Data: Step 1: It is extremely important to understand that companies in the real world will periodically adjust their financial results. The 2018 results that were originally reported on the 2018 10-K may be changed/adjusted on the 2020 10-K. For this reason you must use all information needed from the most recent 10-K. Then go to the next most recent 10-K and gather any information not already provided in the most recent 10-K. For example use the 2018 Sales disclosed on the most recent (i.e. 2020 10-K) not on the original 2018 10-K. Step 2: On the template you will see certain rows that are highlighted in blue (i.e. Operating Income Net Income Total Assets etc.). You need to type a formula into each of these rows. The formulas are left in for you on CLX to help you understand the logic. The purpose of this step is so that when you adjust the statements the major line items (i.e. Operating Income Net Income Total Assets etc.) will automatically adjust too. The items listed below should all use a formula which means this number should not be copied over in step 3. Verify that each of these lines matches the 10-K before you make adjustments. You need to use formulas in: 1. Inventory Net (this only applies to PG) 2. Total Current Assets 3. Total Assets 4. Total Current Liabilities 5. Total Liabilities 6. Total Equity 7. Total Liabilities plus Total Equity 8. Operating Income 9. EBT 10. Any version of Net Income (some firms have two or three levels of Net Income on the Income Statement). Step 3: Now that you understand the process you need to begin copying your information from the downloaded spreadsheets to the template. Check the row at the bottom of the Balance Sheet. It should say YESù if your Balance Sheet is in balance. If it does not say YESù then something is wrong with your spreadsheet. Special Note: You may find that PG (or another company) chooses to not list cash as a line item on the Balance Sheet. If you find this then you need to look at the bottom row (ending cash balance) on the Statement of Cash Flows. This is an annoyance but you are dealing with real-world data and it is sometimes a little messy and not consistent. You may also find that a company reports Interest Expense as a negative number (i.e. in parenthesis). This is just a display issue. If interest expense were negative then someone is paying the company to take out a loan. Enter the absolute value of Interest Expense. Adjustments: An analyst will make adjustments to reported financial statements. The easiest adjustment is for one-time items that are not expected to keep happening (i.e. disposition expenses retirement plan charges goodwill impairment asset writeoffs etc.). Check Column O on the Income Statement for instructions on some items that need to be made zero if they exist in a given year. Since you used formulas in step 2 of the last section your main items of interest will automatically adjust. Calculations: Note: All calculations must involve a formula in Excel. You need to use cell references and write out your formulas. Do not just use Excel functions except for the AVERAGE function which is acceptable for the 5-year average for each ratio. Step 1: Before you begin making calculations please make sure that you notice the comment in cell D16 on the Ratio Summary page the data that I am giving to you in row 46 on the Balance Sheet the NIBCL notations in column N on the Balance Sheet the WACC that I give to you in row 24 on the Income Statement and all comments in column O on the Income Statement. Also please make sure that you are using the course ebook as a guide for all formulas. Step 2: You will see columns on the Balance Sheets and Income Statements on the Excel template labeled with CS%ù. These are for the Common Size percentages. On the Income Statement these percentages are all based on Sales. On the Balance Sheet these percentages are all based on Total Assets. Step 3: You will be calculating financial ratios on the Ratio Summaryù tab on the Excel template. You need to use cell references for all formulas. DO NOT simply type in numbers. You need to use formulas. You will automatically lose 10% of the assignment grade if you simply type in numbers rather than use formulas. Part of this assignment is about learning how to use Excel. You will likely need to learn how to use parenthesis to isolate the order of operations in your formulas. Also make sure that you are using cell references in all formulas. Do not simply type numbers into the cells. Step 4: Calculate the ratios for each company. In Excel you can use the $ù symbol to lock in a cell so that you can drag a formula across a row. Make sure that you know which formulas require averaging and why they need averaging. Step 5: Calculate the five-year averages (in each row) using the AVERAGE function in Excel. The CAGR is completely different. Look at the CAGR discussion in the ebook for examples of exactly how to do this. For the Revenue CAGR row on the Ratio Summary tab you need a one-year CAGR for each individual year and a five-year CAGR for the five-year average. Apply the same logic for the Net Income CAGR. Make sure that you are using the right row for Net Income. See the highlighted comment in cell O15 on the Income Statement for PG on the template provided. Check the Annual Report: Step 1: Google the Annual Report for Proctor & Gambleù. The annual report contains all of the financial statements that you have already worked with in Excel but they are packaged in a way to be more digestible for investors. The Annual Report also includes a very valuable enhancement called Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A). Pay attention to strategic goals any mention of organicù sales growth any mentions of risks or opportunities that they are facing. Also pay attention to any comments about Research & Development (R&D). It is not a good sign for a company to have weak organic sales growth and/or declining R&D spending. You need to replicate this process for Colgate and Clorox so that you are discussing the MD&A for all three firms. Analysis and Discussion: You need to analyze each ratio calculated. This means all three firms. You want to consider: (1) the current calculation; (2) the five-year average for the metric in question; and (3) the trend. Your paper should include this depth of discussion. You need a subheading on your discussion paper for each bulleted item below. Note: Your subheadings should look professional and not simply be a series of bulleted items or be a copy and paste from my list below. MD&A Discussion Current Ratio Discussion Quick Ratio Discussion EBITDA (per share) Discussion Inventory DOH Discussion Receivables DOH Discussion Total Asset Turnover Discussion Debt-to-Equity Ratio Discussion Interest Coverage Discussion Discussion of CAGRs (both revenue and net income) Profit Margin Discussion Return on Assets Discussion EVA Discussion DuPont ROE Discussion Investment Recommendation In each of these subheading areas you need to discuss the current value of the metric the trend of the metric and the five-year average of the metric. Make sure that you interpret the numbers and what they mean to an investor. Each subheading should discuss all three companies all conclude with a statement in boldface of which firm wins based on this metric in your opinion. You also need to make a recommendation on how to allocate $100000 between these three stocks. Focus on strong logic and use details from your financial analysis to inform your recommendation.

Your first company is Proctor & Gamble and the ticker symbol is PG. After you type in the ticker select your company from the drop-down list that appears. (Do not type PG and then press enter. Wait for the dropdown list to load.) When the search result loads a page that says EDGAR: Company Search Resultsù then you need to select Classic Versionù in the upper right corner. At this point you should see a series of rows with company filings listed with the most recent filings at the top. You will see in Row 1 on the template which annual reports (10-Ks) you need to find. Locate your first 10-K and select the blue oval that says Interactive Dataù. Once the new page loads just below the company's name in the upper left corner you will see a link that says View Excel Documentù. Click this link and you will download the full 10-K which includes the Balance Sheet the Income Statement and the Statement of Cash Flows. At this point you should just be gathering data. Download all spreadsheets needed first. See Row 1 on the Excel template. Wait to use the data until the next section on these instructions. Step 4: Repeat step 3 to gather all needed information for Proctor & Gamble. In Row 1 on the provided template you will see all the 10-Ks that you need to gather. Step 5: Repeat step 3 to gather all needed information on your second company which is Colgate Palmolive (ticker: CL). Your third company under analysis is Clorox (ticker: CLX). I have provided you with the information that you need for CLX so that you can see how this process is done. Using the Downloaded Data: Step 1: It is extremely important to understand that companies in the real world will periodically adjust their financial results. The 2018 results that were originally reported on the 2018 10-K may be changed/adjusted on the 2020 10-K. For this reason you must use all information needed from the most recent 10-K. Then go to the next most recent 10-K and gather any information not already provided in the most recent 10-K. For example use the 2018 Sales disclosed on the most recent (i.e. 2020 10-K) not on the original 2018 10-K. Step 2: On the template you will see certain rows that are highlighted in blue (i.e. Operating Income Net Income Total Assets etc.). You need to type a formula into each of these rows. The formulas are left in for you on CLX to help you understand the logic. The purpose of this step is so that when you adjust the statements the major line items (i.e. Operating Income Net Income Total Assets etc.) will automatically adjust too. The items listed below should all use a formula which means this number should not be copied over in step 3. Verify that each of these lines matches the 10-K before you make adjustments. You need to use formulas in: 1. Inventory Net (this only applies to PG) 2. Total Current Assets 3. Total Assets 4. Total Current Liabilities 5. Total Liabilities 6. Total Equity 7. Total Liabilities plus Total Equity 8. Operating Income 9. EBT 10. Any version of Net Income (some firms have two or three levels of Net Income on the Income Statement). Step 3: Now that you understand the process you need to begin copying your information from the downloaded spreadsheets to the template. Check the row at the bottom of the Balance Sheet. It should say YESù if your Balance Sheet is in balance. If it does not say YESù then something is wrong with your spreadsheet. Special Note: You may find that PG (or another company) chooses to not list cash as a line item on the Balance Sheet. If you find this then you need to look at the bottom row (ending cash balance) on the Statement of Cash Flows. This is an annoyance but you are dealing with real-world data and it is sometimes a little messy and not consistent. You may also find that a company reports Interest Expense as a negative number (i.e. in parenthesis). This is just a display issue. If interest expense were negative then someone is paying the company to take out a loan. Enter the absolute value of Interest Expense. Adjustments: An analyst will make adjustments to reported financial statements. The easiest adjustment is for one-time items that are not expected to keep happening (i.e. disposition expenses retirement plan charges goodwill impairment asset writeoffs etc.). Check Column O on the Income Statement for instructions on some items that need to be made zero if they exist in a given year. Since you used formulas in step 2 of the last section your main items of interest will automatically adjust. Calculations: Note: All calculations must involve a formula in Excel. You need to use cell references and write out your formulas. Do not just use Excel functions except for the AVERAGE function which is acceptable for the 5-year average for each ratio. Step 1: Before you begin making calculations please make sure that you notice the comment in cell D16 on the Ratio Summary page the data that I am giving to you in row 46 on the Balance Sheet the NIBCL notations in column N on the Balance Sheet the WACC that I give to you in row 24 on the Income Statement and all comments in column O on the Income Statement. Also please make sure that you are using the course ebook as a guide for all formulas. Step 2: You will see columns on the Balance Sheets and Income Statements on the Excel template labeled with CS%ù. These are for the Common Size percentages. On the Income Statement these percentages are all based on Sales. On the Balance Sheet these percentages are all based on Total Assets. Step 3: You will be calculating financial ratios on the Ratio Summaryù tab on the Excel template. You need to use cell references for all formulas. DO NOT simply type in numbers. You need to use formulas. You will automatically lose 10% of the assignment grade if you simply type in numbers rather than use formulas. Part of this assignment is about learning how to use Excel. You will likely need to learn how to use parenthesis to isolate the order of operations in your formulas. Also make sure that you are using cell references in all formulas. Do not simply type numbers into the cells. Step 4: Calculate the ratios for each company. In Excel you can use the $ù symbol to lock in a cell so that you can drag a formula across a row. Make sure that you know which formulas require averaging and why they need averaging. Step 5: Calculate the five-year averages (in each row) using the AVERAGE function in Excel. The CAGR is completely different. Look at the CAGR discussion in the ebook for examples of exactly how to do this. For the Revenue CAGR row on the Ratio Summary tab you need a one-year CAGR for each individual year and a five-year CAGR for the five-year average. Apply the same logic for the Net Income CAGR. Make sure that you are using the right row for Net Income. See the highlighted comment in cell O15 on the Income Statement for PG on the template provided. Check the Annual Report: Step 1: Google the Annual Report for Proctor & Gambleù. The annual report contains all of the financial statements that you have already worked with in Excel but they are packaged in a way to be more digestible for investors. The Annual Report also includes a very valuable enhancement called Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A). Pay attention to strategic goals any mention of organicù sales growth any mentions of risks or opportunities that they are facing. Also pay attention to any comments about Research & Development (R&D). It is not a good sign for a company to have weak organic sales growth and/or declining R&D spending. You need to replicate this process for Colgate and Clorox so that you are discussing the MD&A for all three firms. Analysis and Discussion: You need to analyze each ratio calculated. This means all three firms. You want to consider: (1) the current calculation; (2) the five-year average for the metric in question; and (3) the trend. Your paper should include this depth of discussion. You need a subheading on your discussion paper for each bulleted item below. Note: Your subheadings should look professional and not simply be a series of bulleted items or be a copy and paste from my list below. MD&A Discussion Current Ratio Discussion Quick Ratio Discussion EBITDA (per share) Discussion Inventory DOH Discussion Receivables DOH Discussion Total Asset Turnover Discussion Debt-to-Equity Ratio Discussion Interest Coverage Discussion Discussion of CAGRs (both revenue and net income) Profit Margin Discussion Return on Assets Discussion EVA Discussion DuPont ROE Discussion Investment Recommendation In each of these subheading areas you need to discuss the current value of the metric the trend of the metric and the five-year average of the metric. Make sure that you interpret the numbers and what they mean to an investor. Each subheading should discuss all three companies all conclude with a statement in boldface of which firm wins based on this metric in your opinion. You also need to make a recommendation on how to allocate $100000 between these three stocks. Focus on strong logic and use details from your financial analysis to inform your recommendation.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/28/man5730-hrm-fundamentals-task-case-study-to-facebook-or-not-to-facebook-for-the/,For the past six months you have been heading a committee in charge of hiring a new division manager. It is been a gruelling process  filtering through thousands of applications seemingly endless meetings and discussions debating people's qualifications so many interviews in different cities that it's hard to remember whom you met and where and even more debates about who should be flown to your headquarters for a day of final interviews. But it is almost all over now. After so many interviews meetings and discussions the committee has settled on a candidate that everyone thinks is ideal for the job  highly educated lots of management experience a great personality driven to succeed and willing to learn. He was near the top of your list when you began this process six months ago and here he is now in first place at the finish line. You head into the last hiring committee meeting with lots of relief. Not only are you happy that you found the right person for the job but you are really glad that this meeting is just going be a formality. No more debates or arguments about applicants' work experiences education or hobbies. Just walk on in take a quick vote and then make a call with the job offer. But as you walk into the committee meeting there is a strange vibe. Some people look quite worried whereas others are just angry. When you ask what is going on one of the committee members responds that in the past few days she added the final candidate as a friend on Facebook and what she found on his profile was quite disturbing. There were several photos of him passed out on the street after drinking too much. Other photos showed him smoking marijuana at a friend's apartment. Another photo showed him wearing an inappropriate costume for what you assume was a dress-up party. And there is the language  almost all of his posts are filled with obscenities. After seeing all of this half the committee wants to go with another candidate. They cannot imagine that this is the kind of person they want leading your company's most important division. The other half of the committee thinks it is not a big deal at all. They believe that how he spends his personal time is absolutely no reflection on his ability to manage and they are angry that committee members would try to use it against him. So here you are faced with a split (and angry) committee. They are looking to you to break the deadlock  should we hire this guy or move on to someone else? 1. On what basis would you decide whether to hire this person or re-open the search?    Read less,man5730 hrm fundamentals  task case study to facebook or not to facebook for the
https://scribing.shop/2021/10/28/nm11-business-and-law-mike-and-waqas-are-acquaintances/,Mike and Waqas are acquaintances who choose to live their lives without the use of modern forms of communication or technology. Last month in a local social club Mike offered Waqas his collection of Star Wars' movie memorabilia for ¬£1000. The collection included a Chewbacca costume used by the production studio and a rare model of the Millennium Falcon. Waqas asked Mike for òtime to think about it' and in response Mike said òI will keep it open until the 10th of September that's seven days from tomorrow'.  On leaving the social club they exchanged addresses. Two days' later Waqas sent a letter to Mike asking whether he would consider taking ¬£800 for the collection. Mike took Waqas' request as an indication that Waqas did not want the items for ¬£1000 and as Mike discovered that Olie his brother would be willing to pay ¬£1000 for them sold and delivered the collection to Olie for ¬£1000. On the 8th of September Waqas realising that the week was almost up and having heard nothing from Mike decided to send a letter to Mike accepting Mike's offer. This letter arrived at Mike's house on the 10th of September a day after a letter arrived at Waqas' house from Mike telling Waqas that the memorabilia had been sold to someone else. Waqas is gravely disappointed on hearing this news as he had a buyer Sunny lined up who was willing to pay ¬£1500 for the collection. Advise Waqas and Mike as to their respective legal position.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/29/discuss-a-future-trend-that-int/,Part 1: Choose one sector of the hospitality industry and discuss a future trend that interests you. Part 2: Read 2 of my classmate's discussions and write 2 responses. Each response for each classmate's discussion. Philip Jalal Alishaq's Discussion: I found Restaurant Table Booking Chatbotù video interesting because we learned that technology is improving every year and we are creating new things every day. The video discussed it takes five minutes to make a sandwich.  The video mentioned that if we create more robots it might take jobs from people. But they discussed that the robot would only make the food and another employee could do other things so It would not take any jobs from people. I think it is pretty cool to see it in person so I will definitely visit that place. I also think that the more technology is expanding the more new things we are seeing that it is improving our lives. I have seen so many videos on how the robots are a good thing to have because it makes it easier for people to get things done. Jon Ryberg's Discussion: This week I found the Example Smart Hotelù video to be a great example of future trends in the hospitality industry. In a world where we see more and more self service machines popping up every week I believe it is evident that it will expand to hotels in the near future. Last week I went to the CVS store by my home and checked out with a person at the counter. Only days later I went to the same store and no workers were at the checkout rather they installed multiple self checkout machines.  I noticed in the video the women used her phone as a room key I have been to a hotel that actually already implemented that which was an indication about the trend occurring. I believe this trend is both good and bad; good for the customer and bad for the staff. With implementations like this we will only see a decrease in necessary staff and loss of jobs.  Nonetheless making the experience easier for the consumer is key. Below is an example of a response that you can follow: Hi Philip I thought this to be interesting as well especially just to see how advanced technology has become. I think the thought of having these robots to make the food is so cool it's something I never thought would actually be created and used in the real world. However it is a little bit concerning for the sake of taking jobs away from people. It's hard to decide if it's a good thing or not because it would get the job done quicker and easier but on the other hand people's jobs could be at stake.

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/30/amb336-marketingemployees-and-country/,Assignment Cepuros Foods Malaysia: Finding the Secret Sauce for Growth After ending her weekly conference call with executives from the corporate headquarters of Cepuros Foods International (CFI) in Singapore Shelby Diaz looked out the window of her office in Kuala Lumpur hoping for inspiration. As the country manager for Cepuros Foods International Malaysia (CFI-M) Diaz was responsible for developing and marketing CFI-M's products. She needed to increase the sales of CFI-M's Baik Sos Salsa line of shelf-stable salsas by the end of 2019. Diaz had begun the call by explaining her plan to target new products to CFI's existing salsa customers with small increases to the marketing and communications budget. She had planned to target customers who purchased the original salsa to try the new flavors. Her proposal was to increase salsa sales 15% by increasing selling expenses by 7%. CFI's CEO Bia Aati interrupted her. He said The proposal lacks a long-term vision. The success of the salsa line is essential to our revenue growth in Malaysia. We need an aggressive mass-market strategy with major investments in marketing and an ambitious sales goal.ù CFI's executive vice president of marketing Chen Lee disagreed. She said Growing revenue through salsa sales is important but a mass-market approach is too risky. Targeting our marketing mainly to our current cooking sauce and salsa customers is more reasonable.ù Before next week's call Diaz had to decide how to revise her proposal. She remembered the Ansoff's matrix used in her MBA program and decided to use it to frame her recommendations.1 Should she change the proposal to develop consumer demand in the mass mark Cepuros Foods International CFI was founded by Vivekasugha Alifù Bin Gunnaalan in Singapore where his parents had been successful restauranteurs. After earning a degree in food technology Gunnaalan first developed products for global food companies. In 1987 he founded CFI. CFI specialized in the development branding and marketing of cooking and table sauces with unique flavor profiles. By 2017 CFI had more than 50 employees and country offices across Southeast Asia. (Exhibit 1 shows CFI's income statement for 2017.) CFI partnered with local food manufacturers and distributors to produce its sauces. In 2017 Singapore accounted for 48% of CFI's sales with Indonesia (21%) Malaysia (12%) Vietnam (10%) and the Philippines (9%) accounting for CFI's other revenue. Malaysia in 2018 Comprising two regions separated by the South China Sea Malaysia contained multiple ethnic groups who spoke 134 living languages. Its official language was Bahasa Malaysia; the official religion was Muslim. Malaysia's urban population was growing; more than one-fourth of its citizens lived in the greater Kuala Lumpur area known as Klang Valley. Exhibit 2 provides country statistics. Requirements Section 1. Identify and provide a brief summary of international market specific issues constraints and opportunities related to the case. Base your issues on theoretical international concepts. As the international marketing manager what are the pertinent environmental and ethical issues to consider in this case? Use journals to help give your responses some depth. Section 2. Answer the following questions: 1.What factors determine the demand for Baik Sos cooking sauces in Malaysia? 2.What are the differences between the factors affecting demand for Baik Sos cooking sauces and the demand for Baik Sos Salsa? 3.Undertake a SWOT analysis for CFI-M's situation in 2017. 4.How should CFI develop the salsa market in Malaysia? 5.How should CFI-M allocate its marketing investments?

https://scribing.shop/2021/10/30/finc3017-investments-and-portfolio-management-2/,Question: You have recently joined an investment management team and are tasked by the lead portfolio manager with implementing an investment strategy that follows the Treynor-Black optimization model. The portfolio has a large-cap style focus investing in listed U.S. equities and benchmarked to the S&P500 total return index. Working with the research analysts in your team you compile data on a set of companies that meet the screening criteria. The relevant details based on monthly excess return series are contained in the accompanying spreadsheet òReport 2  Data.xlsx'. Unless otherwise stated assume these data represent the appropriate inputs to incorporate into your portfolio optimization and no further adjustments are required. Further assume that your portfolio has no investment constraints regarding leverage or short-selling. Your deliverable to your portfolio manager is a report that addresses the points listed below. Report structure Assuming the Single Index Model (SIM) appropriately describes security returns and using the given input data present the following results in a table for the optimal risky portfolio(ORP): The optimal active portfolio weight The optimal market portfolio weight The optimal weight of each individual security The ORP expected risk premium The ORP beta The ORP variance The ORP information ratio The ORP Sharpe ratio Compare the Sharpe ratio for the ORP found in part (1) with the Sharpe ratio for the market portfolio and the Sharpe ratio for the active portfolio. Specifically for the active portfolio present the following results in a table: The alpha of the active portfolio The beta of the active portfolio The information ratio of the active portfolio Comment on the influence of each statistic in part (3) on the composition of the ORP. How would changes in each of these inputs affect the weight of the active portfolio in the ORP? Determine the covariance matrix and correlation matrix for the stocks in the Information Technology sector and present the results for each matrix in a separate table. Discuss your results in part (5). What if anything does the analysis in part (5) tell us about the appropriateness of the SIM for portfolio construction? What further analysis if any should you undertake to assess the appropriateness of the SIM? (Note: discussion only no calculations required) Conclude with a brief discussion of the benefits and limitations of using the Single Index Model compared to the Markowitz approach to optimal portfolio construction. Alongside your report you must submit an Excel spreadsheet with your workings and follow all further requirements outlined below.

Philomena owns a bookshop which specialises in acquiring and selling rare books. She recently saw an advertisement in a specialist book magazine for a first edition of a book written by Niccol≤ Machiavelli. The advertisement which had been placed by Mark Harrington of Harrington's Rare Books stated that it was òon offer for ¬£1000'.  Philomena telephoned Mark on Monday morning. She informed Mark that she would buy the book for ¬£750. Mark replied that he would sell it for ¬£900. Philomena responded by saying she would need some time to think about buying the book for ¬£900. Mark informed Philomena that he would not sell the book to anyone else until Philomena phoned him back in three days' time with her final decision. On the same day that Philomena had telephoned Mark Ronan visited Philomena's shop that afternoon. Ronan asked Philomena if she had a first edition of the book written by Niccol≤ Machiavelli and told Philomena that he would be willing to pay ¬£1500 for such a book. Philomena informed Ronan that she would be able to obtain and sell him the book. Ronan was delighted and paid Philomena the ¬£1500 in cash.  She informed Ronan that he would be able to collect the book on Friday at 4pm. As soon as Ronan left the shop Philomena telephoned Mark. She informed Mark that she would purchase the book for ¬£900. However Mark informed Philomena that he had already sold the book to Greta for the asking price of ¬£1000. Philomena has been searching the internet and managed to find another first edition of the book written by Niccol≤ Machiavelli. It is on sale in a bookshop called Golden Treasures which is owned by Herbie Tomkins. Philomena telephones Herbie on Tuesday morning and asks if he still has the first edition of the book written by Niccol≤ Machiavelli. Herbie confirms he has the book and the asking price is ¬£1300. Philomena informs Herbie that she needs some time to think about the price but will call him back at 5pm today. Philomena decided to purchase the book from Herbie for ¬£1300 as she will still make a ¬£200 profit on the resale to Ronan. Philomena telephones Herbie at 5.35pm.  Unfortunately Herbie closed the shop at 5.30pm and her call is taken by the answer machine. Philomena is informed that the shop is now closed and will reopen on Thursday at 10am and to leave a message. Philomena leaves the following message for Herbie: òHi Herbie this is Philomena. I telephoned you today about the purchase of the first edition of the book written by Niccol≤ Machiavelli at a purchase price of ¬£1300. I wish to accept your offer and will collect the book this Friday no later than 11am. I will put a cheque for ¬£1300 in the post with a covering letter confirming my purchase. Bye for now.' Philomena then writes a short letter confirming she is buying the book and places a cheque for ¬£1300 inside the envelope with the letter. She writes the address of Herbie's shop on the front of the envelope and posts the letter on Tuesday evening. On Wednesday morning Herbie's shop cleaner let's himself in to the shop.  He unplugs the answer machine so he can use the vacuum cleaner but forgets to plug the answer machine back into the electrical socket when he finishes. On Thursday morning Herbie opens his shop and his first customer is Tanisha. She asks Herbie if he has a first edition of the book written by Niccol≤ Machiavelli. He informs Tanisha that he has one copy of the book and the asking price is ¬£1300. Tanisha agrees to buy the book pays and leaves taking the book with her. On Friday morning at 9am Herbie discovers that his answer machine has been unplugged. He immediately plugs in the answer machine and listens to Philomena's message. Ten minutes later Philomena's letter along with the cheque for ¬£1300 arrives. At 11am Philomena arrives at Herbie's shop only to discover that the book has been sold to Tanisha.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/01/acct-5554-financesimulation-models/,You need to create a simulation in Excel You simulation will need to determine the likelihood of running out of money in retirement for different withdrawal rates. Please see the presentation for additional guidance You need to model a retirement portfolio over a 30 year time horizon from age 65 to 95. You need to consider the effect of the withdrawal rate on the likelihood of running out of money before age 95. Once you determine a withdrawal rate (%) consider how much money you need to start with to have the dollar amount of withdrawals you would like to have. Once you have completed this use the simulation spreadsheet I created (you can access after completing the learning objective survery) to determine how much of your income you should save for retirement if you start at age 25 and retire at age 65. The withdrawal rate needs to be defined as a percentage of your beginning balance since you will presumably need to maintain a certain standard of living. You may ignore taxes and inflation for all these calculations but know that in real life we cannot! Simulation models are important and I hope you will allow me the indulgence of a non accounting topic for this assignment‚ knowing that accountants also retire (so do college professors) Create a report on your findings including the sensitivity analysis for withdrawal rates as well as explanations of how you calculated how much money you need and how much you need to save to get to that amount. Include the amount of risk you are willing to accept. This should be thorough but 2-3 pages should be sufficient (this is just a guideline not a restriction). Also upload an excel spreadsheet showing your model. If you copied my model also include it showing your calculations.    Read less,ACCT 5554 Finance|Simulation Models

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/01/bba-407-strategic-management/,Discussion Question: What corporate diversification strategy is being pursued by Sany? What evidence do you have that supports your position? Mini-case: Sany Heavy Industry Co. Ltd The Sany Heavy Industry Co. Ltd is China's largest producer of heavy equipment. In fact it is the fifth largest producer of this type of equipment globally. In 2014 its revenue was decreasing because of the downturn of overall GNP in China. Sany's total sales revenue in 2012 was $12.9 billion well behind industry leader Caterpillar at $65.9 billion. However Sany has a goal of eventually unseating Caterpillar as the industry leader. Sany plans to achieve $47 billion in annual sales within 10 years. Sany has already surpassed Caterpillar as a leader in its Chinese domestic markets. Sany has four core businesses: (1) cranes (2) road construction machinery (3) port machinery and (4) pumpover machinery. While each is distinct some similar technologies are used in the production and equipment. Furthermore similar technologies allow similarities in production processes and equipment for certain parts. Therefore there is a transfer of knowledge across these businesses. In addition customers and markets share some similarities because all relate to some form of construction. For this reason in the United States Sany has become a major sponsor of a Chevrolet on the NASCAR auto racing circuit. Sany America's marketing director Joe Hanneman said that research showed NASCAR racing events to be the primary recreation event for people in the U.S. construction industry. Sany invests 5 percent of its annual sales in R&D to continuously improve the quality of existing products identify new technologies and develop new products. Through the end of 2012 Sany held 3303 patents as a result of its R&D efforts. Indicative of its intent to be a technological leader in its industry Sany has developed new postdoctoral research centers to attract top research scientists. In 2013 the company was awarded China's National Technology Invention Prize for its super-length-boomù technology. Although it has been pursuing technological innovations Sany was recently accused of patent violations by Manitowoc a diversified producer of equipment including large cranes. In 2014 a judgement went against Sany concluding one Sany crane product infringed one of Manitowoc's patents and that six trade secrets of Manitowoc were both protectable as trade secrets and misappropriated.ù This is a negative signal for Sany as it seeks to pursue more diversified growth outside of China. Sany continues to grow organically and through acquisitions. For example in 2012 it acquired Putzmeister a well-known concrete pump manufacturer. In addition it has established subsidiaries in many countries including the United States Germany and Brazil to enhance its international equipment sales and broaden its market reach. Largely because of its major goal of internationalization it is moving its corporate headquarters from Changsha to Beijing for enriched international connections.

Online Turnitin Online Turnitin Specific assessment Rubric Question 1  Abdul Abdul has resided in Australia since he was 2 years of age (Abdul was born on 10 January 1996) and entered Australia under the auspice of a Class XB Subclass 200 Refugee visa. Abdul rebelled when he was in his late-teens and got involved with the wrong friendship group. Consequently in June 2016 Abdul was convicted of robbery (section 411 of the Criminal Code 1899 (Qld)) and was given a head sentence of 16 months imprisonment (Abdul only served 2 months before being released on Parole). Since his time in prison Abdul has turned his life around and is now happily married to an Australian citizen (Carey) and they have a newborn (Sarah) together. On 18 February 2021 Abdul was playing with his child at the park and there was an altercation with another parent. Abdul lost his temper and punched another man knocking his teeth out. The police were subsequently called and Abdul was found guilty of assaults occasioning bodily harm (section 339 of the Criminal Code 1899 (Qld)) and given a head sentence of 6 months imprisonment to be suspended after serving 2 months. Abdul is currently incarcerated serving his sentence and will be released on 27 November 2021. Carey has engaged you to provide a formal letter of advice on the following: a) Whether Abdul is liable for visa cancellation under section 501(3A) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)? b) If Abdul's visa is cancelled what is the process in accordance with the relevant legislation and case law? c) If Abdul's visa is cancelled what does the Delegate take into account when considering any revocation? Please refer to the facts and relate them to the relevant law/parts in Ministerial Direction No. 90.

Matthew has come to you after lodging a Class SN Subclass 190 Skilled  Nominated (òSN 190') visa in July 2021. Matthew received formal correspondence (dated 18 October 2021) from a delegate of the Department of Home Affairs advising him that they have reason to believe the IELTS test provided with the new application is not genuine and referred specifically to Matthew's ability to meet Public Interest Criteria 4020. The natural justice letter provides Matthew with an opportunity to comment on the adverse information. The IELTS test in question was not provided with the VC 485 visa. Matthew has advised that the IELTS document is not genuine and he panicked as he believed the state sponsorship for New South Wales was closing and he would be unable to lodge the SN 190 visa in time. Matthew is a qualified Biomedical Engineer from his home country (Hong Kong) and has been studying Bachelor of Medicine in Australia in order to become a qualified medical practitioner (which he obtained two years ago in June 2019). Matthew has an exceptional skill-set and has been working in a clinic in Sydney developing a Covid-19 cure for the last 12 months. Matthew has advised that he is the only member in the team with his skill-set and they are close to a break-through. Please advise Matthew of the following in a formal letter of advice: a) Is Matthew's SN 190 visa at risk of refusal in accordance with Public Interest Criteria 4020? If so why? b) What should the natural justice letter contain from the Department of Home Affairs in accordance with the law? c) Provide submissions on why Matthew may be able to satisfy subclause 190.216 having regard only to Public Interest Criteria 4020. d) Advise Matthew in relation to his SN 190 visa application (you must include what potential ramifications Matthew could face in the future having regard to Public Interest Criteria 4020).

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/01/ecm40is-it-strategy-customer-relationship-management/,Integration is the act of bringing together smaller components into a single system that functions as one. In an IT context integration refers to the end result of a process that aims to stitch together different often disparate subsystems so that the data contained in each becomes part of a larger more comprehensive system that ideally quickly and easily shares data when needed. This often requires that companies build a customized architecture or structure of applications to combine new or existing hardware software and other communications. Integration is harder to achieve the greater the number of systems that are involved and companies often choose to have external contractors manage some or all phases of the development of the new system. Specific activities having to do with IT system integration include project planning project management design and implementation of application programming interfaces Web services and any process that accounts for the free flow of data or information delivery. Challenges to achieving integration mostly have to do with the inherent difficulties in linking a series of diverse existing systems that could be produced by multiple different manufacturers. Other integration challenges have to do with the lack of a coherent or unifying data structure linking all of the different systems an unwieldy framework of multiple different applications and support systems the sheer age of the different systems and the actual delivery of the information to key business units that need it. These integration challenges hinder overall process efficiency because poor data exchange between systems prevents quick communication among business units. Because integration is difficult to achieve all at once a common practice is to employ a strategy of short-term ad-hoc objectives that slowly builds towards full integration by linking various subsystems where necessary. These links usually are established between the components of the process and control layer of each system to promote the free flow of data across systems. As more systems are linked more business management and control layers can be connected until all systems are sharing data between each other. Companies strive to integrate their customer relationship management (CRM) systems with other components of the business to help streamline the marketing and sales processes organizing and updating customer information with the hopes of deepening customer relationships and boosting revenue and growth. A main goal of integrating a CRM system with other smaller systems is to prevent manual data entry and save employees time by removing redundant unnecessary or tedious everyday steps. For example a company might integrate its website with its marketing automation software to bring customer information directly into the CRM system. Any action a prospect takes on the website can be logged and a new record can be automatically created in the system. You are required to identify a real company that focuses on Integration of the business processes to implement its business model.

You will include in your analysis the background calculations and managerial analysis for each of the following topics: time value of money stock and bond valuation and capital budgeting. You will also discuss macroeconomic variables that might impact the company's financial decision making and strategic objectives. These topics will be covered over four milestones to be submitted throughout the course before you submit the final project. Note that while these elements may seem separate and unrelated together they will present a well-rounded view of the company's finances with regard to the topics. For this milestone you will submit a draft of the Stock Valuation and Bond Issuance sections of the final project along with your supporting explanations. Prompt: Calculate stock and bond valuations for UPS and use the results to support your explanations of shareholder value and increasing capital. Assess the company's dividend policies and bond issuance policies in your explanations. Complete your calculations on the designated tab of the Final Project Student Workbook. Specifically the following critical elements must be addressed: Roman Two Stock Valuation A. Based on the figures provided calculate each of the following: 1. The new dividend yield if the company increased its dividend per share by 1.75 2. The dividend yield if the firm doubled its outstanding shares 3. The rate of return on equity (i.e. the cost of stock) based on the new dividend yield you calculated above B. What effect would you expect each of the calculations you performed to have in terms of shareholder value? In other words suppose the company's goal is to maximize shareholder value. How will each of the situations support or inhibit that goal? Be sure to justify your reasoning. C. To what extent do you feel the company's dividend policies support or hinder their strategies? For example if the company is attempting to grow are they retaining and reinvesting their earnings rather than distributing them to investors through dividends? Be sure to substantiate your claims. Roman Three Bond Issuance A. Assuming this company already has bonds outstanding calculate the following: 1. The new value of the bond if overall rates in the market increased by 2% 2. The new value of the bond if overall rates in the market decreased by 2% 3. The value of the bond if overall rates in the market stayed exactly the same B. What effect would you expect each of the calculations you performed to have in terms of the company's decision to raise capital in this manner? In other words for each situation would you consider bond valuation to be a viable option for increasing capital? Be sure to justify your reasoning.    Read less,FIN550 Finance|Final Project

For help with writing your assessment please book an appointment with AIB's Academic Skills Advisor Stephanie Schembri: https://stephanieschembri.youcanbook.me/ Learning outcomes Demonstrate advanced understanding of contemporary corporate governance theory frameworks and practice. LO#1 Critically evaluate and effectively communicate complex concepts to recommend improvements relating to corporate governance and organisational issues. LO#2 Apply corporate governance laws theory and techniques to professional practice in an ethical manner. LO#3 Completing Learning Activities in Modules 1 2 and 3 will help you develop your responses to the first assessment. Task Write a 2000-word report to discuss compare explain and evaluate an organisation you select. You will evaluate the corporate governance principles structure and functions to understand the alignment of your selected organisation to the theory concepts or philosophy. Additionally you will investigate and analyse which legislation and corporate governance principles your selected organisation must comply with or voluntarily follows. You will compare your selected organisation with a peer organisation of your choice. Your comparison allows you to comprehensively discuss the two organisations' boards conformance and performance approaches. In practice conformance deals with accountability and supervising executive's activities and is past and present focused. While performance is about strategy formulation and policy making mostly future focused. Accountability and strategy formulation are outward-looking but supervising executive's activities and policy making are inward-looking. Step 1 Select a company and one of its peers (preferably publicly listed companies from the same jurisdiction due to data availability and comparability) and retrieve relevant corporate governance information. As explained in Activity 1.2 you will find the corporate governance information disclosed in the company's most recent annual report (Australian companies) proxy statement (US companies) management proxy circular (Canadian companies) company website or other company statements. For example the Commonwealth Bank of Australia provides governance information in its annual report: (CBA Annual Report). You can usually find these documents on the organisation's or regulator's website. Step 2 Based on the disclosed governance information and relevant governance principles rules and theories evaluate how your selected organisations board structure performs its conformance and performance functions according to the following perspectives: Corporate governance principles: Discuss which theory or philosophy most characterises your selected organisation and why. Explain what legislation and principles or guidelines your selected organisation follows. Corporate governance structures: Evaluate the board structure of your selected organisation in comparison to a peer including director appointments attributes competencies and committees. Corporate governance conformance and performance functions: Compare the board functions of your selected organisation with that of a peer organisation. Discuss the conformance and performance aspects of your selected organisation in comparison to a peer. Board recommendations for your selected organisation: Provide constructive suggestions for improvement to the board of the chosen organisation (i.e. not the peer). Requirements Discuss relevant corporate governance theories legislation and principles in relation to the selected organisation. Where possible draw out and discuss implications (and limitations) for the board structure and conformance and performance functions of the selected organisation and peer boards. Explicitly provide recommendations to the selected board from your report findings The required word length for this report is 2000 words (plus 10% tolerance). You are required to use at least five (5) academic references for this report (in addition to any references for the disclosed corporate governance information such as annual reports). Your references should be from credible sources such as books industry-related journals magazines or academic journal articles. Your grade will be adversely affected if your assignment contains no/poor citations and/or reference list and if your assignment word length is beyond the allowed tolerance level (see Assessment Policy available on AIB website). Resources Please use publicly available secondary data only. Prescribed textbook and learning materials and readings from Modules 13. Disclosed governance information source: annual reports (Australian companies) proxy statement (US organisations) management proxy circular (Canadian organisations) company website or other company statements Corporate governance codes: ASX CGOV Recommendations & Principles OECD principles NYSE CGOV guide ECGI principles AICD non-for-profit governance principles TSX Corporate Governance guidelines. Format The report format should follow AIB Style Guide (i.e. cover page including your name and a student id title and word count of the report executive summary table of contents body list of references and appendix if needed). Please use the AIB Report Template to format your report or use the AIB-preferred Microsoft Word settings. Use author-date style referencing (which includes in-text citations and a reference list).

Overview In your role as controller of a division of TransGlobal Airlines you are responsible for assessing the possible acquisition of the two identified small airlines in the Caribbean specializing in chartered flights for luxury vacations using light aircraft (60 passengers or less). One of the important steps in this acquisition process is analyzing understanding and identifying all the external and internal elements that can affect the organization's performance and as businesses are greatly influenced by their environment all the situational factors that determine how day-to-day circumstances impact firms. You can assess situational factors by performing a business environment analysis. The analysis entails assessing the level of threat or opportunity these situational factors might present. These evaluations are later translated into the decision-making process. The analysis helps align strategies with the firm's environment. You will use the PESTEL method to perform this analysis. Prompt Use the information provided to you in the TransGlobal Airlines Information document to perform a business environment analysis using the PESTEL method. Your task is to analyze the internal and external business environment of TransGlobal Airlines by identifying the impact of each PESTEL factor on the business environment. Specifically you must address the following rubric criteria: 1. Identify one political factor that can affect the company's business environment and explain any potential impact on acquisition strategy. 2. Identify one economic factor that can affect the company's business environment and explain any potential impact on acquisition strategy. 3. Identify one sociological factor that can affect the company's business environment and explain any potential impact on acquisition strategy. 4.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/02/mgt518-global-business-management-international-markets-charge/,Should Companies Marketing Their Products to International Markets Charge Lower Prices in Developing Markets than They Do in Developed Markets?ù  This question has become more important in recent years as developed nations reach out in a variety of ways to lesser-developed ones. Examples include the G-20 nations providing the International Monetary Fund with $1 trillion in April of 2009 to assist developing nations experiencing economic problems and the United States supplying greater levels of economic aid to developing nations in Africa.  Companies in developed nations have a no- blesse oblige to improve the standard of living for people in developing countries that are less fortunate than people in developed countries. Aside from this argument if the standard of living in poorer nations is improved there would be more income to purchase more products from companies in developed nations that are charging the lower prices. If the products include prescription drugs life expectancies in developed countries will also be improved. Companies have the major obligation to their stockholders not to individuals in developing countries. Stockholders benefit if the prices of the stocks they hold increase in value. This is most likely to occur if profits are increased. Charging lower prices may jeopardize a company's profits; lower prices may lead to allegations of dumping. Another option may be to give the products away. With the tax savings achieved the company's profits may exceed those obtained by selling the products at lower prices in developing markets.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/03/ass0072-global-public-health-sustainable-development-goal/,A: Introduction Provide a brief introduction to the chosen country for the case study (e.g. country's population relevant WHO region it belongs t and other key useful indicators of note such as life expectancy demography/age structure of the country's population maternal mortality rates and GDP and a summary of the country's main health challenges). B: The main health issues/challenges in the country You must choose 3 contemporary public health issues in the chosen country. The three public health issues must focus on 1 communicable disease 1 non-communicable disease and 1 health issue that is grouped as an accident/intentional or unintentionalbinjury in that country. You must address all these three categories effectively. For each health issue you must 1. Describe the scale of the health challenge (e.g. social group that are most affected mortality rates or DALYs attributable to this issue and any other notable patterns). 2. identify the main risk factors predisposing affected social groups to this issue and 3. discuss how the health issue is tackled by the government or another global health body in that country. This section B must include at least one relevant illustration of health data (e.g. a chart table or graph). Data for this section should be based on sound and recent global health data from credible global sources of statistics such as the World Health Organisation the Institute of Health Metrics data and evaluation website and the òOur world in Data' website. Students may also support discussions from these sources section with relevant peer-reviewed academic sources signposted in the reading list and their own independent study.  C: A description of the health system in the country. In this section the student needs to a. Provide a brief discussion of how the health system is organised at various levels of care and delivers Universal Health coverage to the country's population b. The student must choose and clearly identify one aspect of the WHO building blocks of the country's health system and write brief points about the following: ¢ Use a relevant graph/Chart/table from a recent and credible source of global health data to describe trends around an indicator related to this building block. The student could also briefly mention issues related to access coverage effectiveness and/or responsiveness of the health system and reasons for the observed implication if relevant. For example if a student chooses to explore data in the last five years that shows that fewer hospital beds are available for chronically ill patients in a country (number of hospital beds being a health indicator of the service delivery block of the health system) it can be suggested that service users in that country may be faced with long waiting times to be admitted in hospitals and may therefore overburden A&E services etc. It may however be that increased demand for hospitalization is due to an increasingly ageing population in that country etc. ¢ Discuss any current initiative(s) by the government or other international organisation to support improved outcomes relating to addressing the issues identified around that indicator. For example is the government of that country planning to build more hospitals? This section C requires at least one illustration of health data to be included. Points in this section must be supported from evidence from credible sources of global health data as well as relevant peer-reviewed academic sources signposted in the reading list and sources found through independent study.  D: Assessing the progress the country has made in reaching a named Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) In this section students should describe the progress the country has made towards meeting any one of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs). To assess a country's performance the student must include relevant graphs or charts on any two targets under the chosen SDG since 2015 to date to support the discussion for the progress the country has made and describe the trends the data shows. For example if a student chooses to explore progress made on SDG5: Gender equality the student may want to explore percentage increases/decreases and/or other rates in how the country has made progress since 2015 to end all violence against women and girls (target 5.2) and eliminate forced marriages and genital mutilation (target 5.3) using relevant illustrations to support their discussion. Students should follow the description by noting any current political economic and/or social issues in the country that are likely to affect the progress in meeting the SDG targets identified. If relevant comparisons can be made to similar countries in the same WHO region who have made much better or worse progress on similar targets. This section D requires that two illustrations of health data are included. Discussion in this section must be based on sound and recent health from data from credible sources of health data about SGSs such as the SDG tracker website the UN website and other credible academic sources.  E: Advocacy statement To conclude the case study the student is to write a paragraph identifying their own suggestion to the chosen country's health ministry in the form of an advocacy statement about what needs to be done to improve the health of the country's population based on issues this case study has brought up. The statement must be followed by three actionable goals the student may want the government of that country to address to tackle the burden of disease to improve the functioning of the health system and to maintain progress in meeting the named SDG goal noted in the case study. Goals should be written as SMART: Specific Measurable Achievable Results-Focused Time Bound. The sources of all the attached graph/chart/table must be clearly noted and their relevance to your discussion must be well signposted throughout the case study. The illustration in the case study must be a chart table or graph. Pictures and infographics that do not illustrate health data should not be included in submissions. A reference list of all sources used must be included at the end of the case study; including all the weblinks to the illustrations cited in the submission. Referencing must conform to the Harvard referencing system.    Read less,ASS0072 Global Public Health : Sustainable Development Goal

Assume you have been asked to develop a proposal for Memorial University to enhance the quality of undergraduate student ratings of teacher performance. Along these lines the University has decided that a lack of student training is one of the major problems that underlie the current system. Specifically you have been asked to develop a training strategy for training students on how to complete the teacher evaluation form. For the assignment please develop a training proposalTo choose your training approach you should consult the performance appraisal training research literature by performing a library search. Here is the library URL that will point you in the right direction: Library Link The best data bases to try are Business source complete and Psycinfo Find research articles or review papers on the topic of performance appraisal training to identify at least three different training approaches that have been used to train performance raters. These articles or papers should not be obtained from an internet site. Only published articles in scientific journals should be used  these articles are rigorously reviewed for quality and are only published if they withstand scrutiny and assessment by experts in the field. You should cite at least 2 articles attesting to the effectiveness of each of your 3 training approaches. There are numerous training approaches to consider in the research literature including but not limited to Behavioural Observation Training and Rater Error Training. Take these 3 approaches you have identified and combine them to develop a comprehensive training strategy combining the three approaches for undergraduate students at MUN. Be sure to (a) describe each specific training approach of your comprehensive training program and provide at least two research-based references that provides evidence the approach should be effective and (b) describe exactly how the training would be conducted for each of the three individual training approaches. For example if one of your training approaches is Rater Error Training describe how the training will be conducted. Specifically describe how you will train students using this approach  lecture videos etc. The reader of your proposal should have a basic understanding of what the training involves and how it will be conducted. The reader should also know how much time will be spent on each individual training approach and how long the overall comprehensive training program should take. Also be sure to provide information concerning when the training will be conducted (e.g. consider how you will ensure that all MUN undergraduate on-campus students receive the training).

The auditors found that the majority of PBI's operating units did not have specific plans in place to address data breaches and in general the company was deemed not readyù to effectively prevent and/or respond to a major data breach. The insurance company has indicated that it will not renew PBI's cyber insurance policy if PBI does not address this deficiency by putting an effective data breach response policy and plan in place. PBI's executive leadership team has established an internal task force to address these problems and close the gaps because they know that the company cannot afford to have its cyber insurance policy cancelled. Unfortunately due to the sensitivity of the issues no management interns will be allowed to shadow the task force members as they work on this high priority initiative.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/03/law2001-corporate-lawcorporations-act-2001/,ASE STUDY 1 Lawrence Bernard and Donald were all executive directors of an insurance company called InsureIt Ltd. Donald was the finance director and Bernard was the Chief Executive Officer of the company. In addition to being a director Lawrence also owned a substantial amount of shares in InsureIt Ltd which was a publicly listed company on the ASX. Lawrence's wife was a director and shareholder of another company called Prime Earnings Pty Ltd. Lawrence requested from Bernard and Donald an advance of $10 million from InsureIt Ltd to be paid to Prime Earnings in return for $10 million worth of the shares of Prime Earnings. Lawrence had a reputation as a finance guru and he told Bernard and Donald that he would use the money to buy sub-prime securities that were doing well overseas. His banker friends were making lots of money by trading these securities. He said that this would make the shares of Prime Earnings very valuable. Prime Earnings had no other assets. Bernard and Donald also knew that Lawrence's wife was a director and shareholder of Prime Earnings and that there were no other assets in Prime Earnings. As Bernard and Donald trusted Lawrence's judgement they did not ask for any security. None of the other directors of InsureIt Ltd knew of this advance. They also did not let the investment committee of the company know of the transfer of the funds. The $10 million was spent as follows: ¢ $5 million was given to Prime Earnings and was used to buy the securities overseas; ¢ $3 million was used by Lawrence to buy more shares in InsureIt Ltd to support its share price on the ASX; and ¢ The remaining $2 million was invested into other private companies where Lawrence and his family had an interest. Lawrence thought he could make a quick profit as he had done in the past. He did not investigate any of these investments in any real way. Soon after this the news from overseas was that the securities were worthless and were causing the collapse of many U.S. companies. This made the Prime Earnings shares now owned by InsureIt Ltd worthless. The other directors of InsureIt found out about the $10 million given to Prime Earnings and they were furious. They have reported the matter to ASIC and want ASIC to investigate Lawrence Bernard and Donald for breaches of the Corporations Act. REQUIRED (a) Advise the other directors of InsureIt Ltd as to any breaches of directors' duties under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) by Lawrence Bernard and Donald and any defences that may be available to them (30 marks) (b) Advise as to any other breaches of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) relating to the use of the funds by Lawrence. (20 marks) Total (50 marks) CASE STUDY 2 Valerie is a non-executive director of an investment company for retirees along the Bellarine peninsula called The Millenial Retirees Pty Ltd. She has basic accounting knowledge and can read a balance sheet. One of the executive directors Samantha put forward a proposal at a board meeting to invest $600000 in a company in India. The company was noted as the most successful IT company for 2020 in India in an independent investment report commissioned by Samantha. Valerie however thought further investigation was needed before the money was invested. Valerie made her own inquiries and rang the authors of the investment report and questioned them further regarding the nature of the IT company in India and its financial status. She was told that there were management problems in the company at the moment but it appeared the company was running well. Valerie suggested to Samantha that she invites one of the representatives of the financial investment company who wrote the report to a board meeting so the directors could ask questions before any decisions were made. Samantha agreed. At the meeting most of the directors did not ask any questions. It seemed most of the directors had not read the report or they did not understand it. The other board members also did not make any of their own inquiries as Valerie had done. Instead they chose to rely on the advice of the representative of the investment company and their report. The resolution by a majority of the board was to invest the $600000. Nine weeks later the Indian company went into liquidation. Fortunately for the The Millenial Retirees Pty Ltd it survived this crisis because of a dynamic advertising campaign that secured 100 new retirees who bought property and concluded long term leasing contracts with The Millenial Retirees Pty Ltd.

The US Strategic Defense Initiative News: The Fascinating Decade in Cybercrime: 2010 to 2020 Source: Arcticwolf.com (Links to an external site.) Cybercrime has become an all-too-familiar topic in today's global headlines. It's clear that along with its multitude of benefits the introduction of new technologies gives attackers opportunities to develop new and easier methods for infiltrating data systems to steal sensitive information. This isn't a new phenomenon. In fact it goes back not just decades but centuries. Technically the first cyberattack happened in France well before the internet was even invented in 1834. Attackers stole financial market information by accessing the French Telegraph system. From that moment on cybercrime has grown exponentially marked by an intriguing history of tactics techniques and proceduresîall implemented for malicious gain. This article takes a look at cybercrime's rapid evolution with a focus on the most prevalent and damaging trends of the past decade. History of Cybercrime up to 2010 If there was a Cybercrime Hall of Infamy its halls would be lined with the names and faces of noted attackers whose groundbreakingù work caught the eye of federal investigators and the envy of fellow hackers. In chronological order here are several notable firstsîand the perpetrators behind them: 1962: The modern history of cybercrime began when Allen Scherr conducted the first cybersecurity attack which he launched against MIT computer networks. He stole passwords from the database by making a punch card. 1971: The first computer virus was created for research purposes by Bob Thomas at BBN technologies. Referred to as the Creeper Virus the self-replicating program was detected on the ARPANET in 1971 and foretold the potential of future viruses to cause significant damage to computer systems. 1981: Ian Murphy became the first person ever to be convicted for committing a cybercrime. He successfully hacked into AT&T's internal systems and changed their computers' clocks causing havoc. 1988: The first major cyberattack on the internet came courtesy of Cornell grad student named Robert Morris. The Morris Wormù struck in the year before the World Wide Web debuted back when the internet was primarily the domain of academic researchers. It infected computer systems at Stanford Princeton Johns Hopkins NASA Lawrence Livermore Labs and UC Berkeley among other institutions.  1995: Kevin Mitnickîone of history's most notorious hackersîbecame the first person to penetrate large networks by manipulating people and using insiders to get the codes. He attacked Motorola Nokia and several other large networks. New Technology Brings New Crime: The 1990s The decade of the ò90s gave rise to some of the greatest communication technologies known to mankind. And above all the internet evolved into the World Wide Web with the aim of connecting people across different communication networks wherever they were all over the world. Along with these advancements however cybercrime emerged. Hackers and bad actors leveraged the fact that as these new technologies were developed and built trust and safety controls weren't initially a major concern. Cybersecurity was a term yet to be coined and the groundbreaking applications for communications and business efficiency was the principal focus for good reason. Nevertheless an underground economy was also born as a result.  Escalating rates of cybercrime signaled that attackers now enjoyed fresh opportunities to devise new means to gain unauthorized access and manipulate data across the web. And devise and manipulate they did. Notable crimes of the decade: 1994: Datastream Cowboy and Kujiîa 16-year-old British schoolboy and his accomplice used a password snifferù program to launch a series of attacks that crippled the Air Force's Rome Laboratory in New Year while stealing research data used as attack instructions for warplanes in battle. 1995: Vladimir Levin was the first known hacker to attempt to rob a bankîand a very big bank at that. He hacked into Citibank's network and conducted an abundance of fraudulent transactions. All told he transferred more than 10 million dollars into various bank accounts worldwide. 1998: Max Butler a security consultant for the FBI among others hacked into US Government websites ostensibly to fix a server vulnerability but the U.S Air Force alerted officials to his deeds and he received an 18-month sentence. Later for another illicit foray he was sentenced to 13 years the most ever for a hacker. 1999: Computer viruses were relatively unknown by the general public until the Melissa Virus struck in March 1999 and affected users all across the internet by corrupting their Microsoft document files and causing an estimate $80 million in damages. Cybercrime Ramps Up: The 2000s The first decade of the new millennium witnessed more sophisticated attacks and an abundance of advanced persistent threat actors (APTs) most of which were sponsored by nation-states. The evolution of cybercrime meant new viruses and worms which provoked significant damages to critical sectors of the digital economy across the world. By decade's end cybersecurity was a concern of computer users everywhere but especially to government agencies and large corporations who had the most at stake. Notable crimes of the decade: 2000: A 15-year old hacker named Michael Calse with the online handle Mafiaboyù launched a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on some of the largest commercial websites like Amazon Yahoo CNN and eBay. The attack brought the sites down for hours in some cases and cost these businesses untold millions. 2005: A security breach at a U.S. retailer led to the data leak of 1.4 million MasterCard users of HSBC Bank. The bank had to issue letters to its customers. 2008: In one of the largest breaches ever Heartland Payment systems were attacked using a combination SQL injection password sniffers and malware and the data of 134 million users were compromised. 2010: The Stuxnet worm called the world's first digital weaponùîattacked nuclear plants in Belarus sabotaging the country's uranium enrichment facilities. 2010: The Zeus Trojan virus was distributed around the world via email in an attack targeting financial services organizations. The 100+-person crime ring based largely in the U.S. managed to steal more than $70 million from American banks. Cyber Threats Grow Increasingly Sophisticated: The 2010s Looking back at the past decade we saw the rapid growth and evolution of cybercrime continueîturning what was once a cottage industry into big business.ù Attackers developed new malicious programs and techniques which increased both the cybercrime rate and the number of cyberattacks per day. Trillions of dollars were lost. It wasn't like businesses didn't recognize the dangers. Beginning around 2010 large organizations began employing more cybersecurity professionals to counter the risk of cyberthreats as the sense of assumed digital security dissipated. And with a demand for constant data security a new field emerged known as ethical hacking; its sole purpose to discover vulnerabilities prior to malicious exploitation. One way to gauge the growth of cybercrime over the past ten years is to understand how much the cybersecurity industry has grown in response to it. The figure below shows its steady growth year of year: The evolution and increased sophistication of different types of cyberthreats and how they're leveraged in attacks puts organizations in precarious positions when it comes to defending against them. To follow are some of the most common cyberthreats along with some of the more notorious attacks in which they were used during the 2010s. Malware Malware is short for malicious software.ù It's designed to harm systems and networks via intrusive and disruptive algorithms changing the normalcy of processes logic and traffic flow. Over the years malware has evolved from simply shutting down a computer to destroying an enemy nation-state's nuclear power plant. With the rise of mobile technologies in recent decades the mobile malware evolution trajectory has eclipsed any type of malware introduced in modern technology. With respect to the ongoing advances in malware future attacks may be nearly impossible to detect and eliminate without damaging an entire network. These new strands of malware are being designed to intertwine with network DNA morphing to resemble normal system activities and processes. Spyware Spyware is a type of malware that infiltrates a computing device with the sole aim of secretly gathering critical information such as login credentials system activities or device location. Spyware has evolved from its suspiciously noisy and resource hogging beginnings to become more sophisticated and almost totally undetectable. Modern spyware in fact incorporates both technical and logical methods to masquerade itself on system scans. The following are notable malware and spyware attacks of the last decade: 2010: In a notorious nation-state attack Operation Aurora was launched by Chinese military hackers on more than 20 leading technology companies. The public was first made aware of the attacks when Google notified the public that its intellectual property had been seized in the attack. 2011: Sony Corporation announced In April that over the course of a few days hackers stole information from 77 million users of its Sony Playstation. This included gamers' usernames and passwords their birthdates answers to security questions and more. It took 23 days to recover the system and remediate the threat. 2013: In perhaps the largest high-profile data leaks of all whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed sensitive information stolen from several foreign governments with spyware software technology as part of the National Security Agency's PRISM surveillance program. Ransomware Ransomware is a type of malware that takes hostage of digital systems and assets. Ransomware can be downloaded in the system through image and video files and it has evolved over time to become increasingly destructive and difficult to detect and prevent. Once attackers deny users access to their files or systems they demand a hefty ransom payment in exchange for renewed access attackers demand hefty ransom payments. Malicious actors typically demanded payments in the form of cryptocurrency or bitcoins. For a variety of reasons victims are encouraged NOT to pay a ransom but in reality they often doîhence the continued success of this type of attack. If possible when interacting with downloadable files strive to scan them for strands of ransomware codes. The Speed at Which a Business Falls Victim to Ransomware Here are a few notable ransomware attacks in the last decade: 2015: The first strains of SamSam ransomware appeared which by 2018 had earned its creator nearly $6 million. Among its highest-profile hostage-takingù strikes were the City of Atlanta and the Colorado Department of Transportation. 2016: TeleCrypt ransomware appeared and largely targeted gamers who downloaded it while playing games online. Luckily a free decrypt tool was quickly created by researchers at Malwarebytes. 2017: Perhaps the most insidious of all ransomware strains WannaCry managed to affect more than 200000 Windows computers in 150 countries. It was especially dangerousîand deadlyîas the UK's National Health Service Hospitals were among the most devastated. It is widely assumed hackers in North Korea were behind the attack. 2017: Just a month later piggybacking on the success of WannaCry was NotPetya an updated version of the earlier ransomware strain. It took out organizations from shipping giant Maersk to multinational pharmaceutical manufacture Merck. Man in the Middle Attacks (MitM) Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks occur when cybercriminals intercept legitimate communications and controls the flow of that communication. Both victims think they are communicating privately but the attacker acts as a man in the middle and tricks both victims. These attacks are usually used to gather attack intelligence for future attacks. To prevent MitM attacks end-to-end encryption is strongly advised. Notable MitM incidents of the last decade: 2011: Due to a security breach in Dutch certificate authority Diginotar an investigation by a third-party firm discovered 300000 Iranian Gmail users were targeted in MitM attacks. 2013: A researcher discovered that Finnish telecommunications Nokia was essentially conducting man-in-the-middle attacks on its smart phone users by sending HTTPs traffic through its servers and decrypting data. The company said it did so to help compress data and keep rates and charges reduced. 2017: Equifax pulled its mobile apps from the Apple and Google app stores after discovering MitM vulnerabilities. This came right on the heels of its publicly announced data breach wherein the personal information and data of more than 147 million Americans was compromised. Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks (DDoS) Distributed denial-of-service attacks occurs when perpetrators flood a system or network with process requests making it unable to provide service temporarily or permanently. This attack sabotages operations and halts business and organizational services making it possible for a cybercriminal to implement secondary attacks. Notable DDoS-attacks of the last decade: 2012: In September six different US banksîincluding Bank of America Wells Fargo and Chaseîwere attacked with 60GB per second leading to simultaneous website outages that meant customers had no access to online banking services. 2013: Spamhaus an international electronic spam-fighting organization was victimized by a then-unprecedented DDoS attack when it was hit with malicious traffic coming in at 300GB per second. 2014: The websites of Occupy Central a Hong Kong grassroots activist movement were attacked with 500GB per second intensity through the use of five botnets. The DDoS attack was meant to stifle the organization's pro-democracy measures. 2018: In the biggest DDoS inundation to date GitHubîa popular developer platform experienced traffic of 1.3 terabytes per second which halted all operations on its server. GitHub had security measures in place far more than most organizations but was simply overwhelmed by the sheer size of the attackîthe biggest ever on record. Phishing Phishing is a social engineering attack which attempts to trick users into revealing sensitive data that can facilitate malicious activities. Phishing has been used to illicitly extract usernames passwords PIN codes banking credentials and more. Phishing has grown quite sophisticated; in many cases users don't even have an inkling something phishyù is taking place. Today almost every company advises employees about the dangers of falling prey to a phishing attack. Social Media Phishing Social media phishing is a kind of cyberattack which uses social media platforms to spread malicious content through deceptive links. When users interact with the malicious link they are exposed to other malicious tactics such as email spoofing drive-by download and other credential-stealing schemes. Almost any invitation link on social media can lead to a phishing attack. Voice Phishing Voice phishing is a form of phone fraud where a caller gathers basic personal information that leads to credential hacking. Usually victims are told of unusual circumstances about their accounts from the caller and are asked to provide credentials for resolution purposes. Voice phishing is in fact a form of social engineering. Therefore organizations must advise customers to never give secret or personal information over the phone. Notable phishing attacks of the last decade: 2013: Over 110 million Target customers had their credit card records stolen in a phishing attack. The scheme involved a malware-laden email to the company's HVAC subcontractor allowing the cybercriminals to gain access credentials to the data. 2015: A successful spear-phishing attack against high-value Defense Department targets with customized emails led to a data breach which compromised information for 4000 military and civilian personnel who worked for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The attack forced the Pentagon to shut down its email system. Only unclassified information was said to be leaked. 2016: The Austrian Aerospace firm FACC AG was defrauded of 50 million Euros in a spear-phishing scheme that tricked a finance employee to transfer the money into back accounts controlled by the cybercriminals. As a result the company's CEO was fired. 2017: A Lithuanian cybercriminal posed as an Asian manufacturer to deceive Google and Facebook employees into wiring over $100 million to untraceable offshore bank accounts. The swindle occurred over the course of two years before his capture. For their part Google claimed to have recouped the funds it had lost. 2018: Cryptocurrency company EOS.IO was attacked. Cybercriminals posed as company representatives and contacted potential investors. The scam succeeded in luring many to provide their private key in order to claim unsold tokens. CryptojackingîAn Evolving Threat Cryptojacking involves secret use of a computer to mine cryptocurrency. During a cryptojacking attackers install a mining program on the target device by sending a malicious malware file to the victim. This file grants the attacker total command-and-control of the device. This malicious activity occurs in stealth mode; victims are unaware that their cryptocurrency is being mined on their device. However the mining depletes other computer resources and users may experience significant reduction in computing power and speed. The highest profile cryptojacking attack to date: 2018: Perhaps the most noted of all cryptojacking instances involves the Coinhiveùattack. Coinhive was a popular cryptocurrency mining service that for a time was considered by leading security firms as the top malicious threat to web users. Its computer code could be used on hacked websites to steal the processing power of that site's vistors' devices. For 15 long months cybercriminals used the malicious program to infect millions of devices. Evolution of Cyber Law In the last decade cyber-related legislation was introduced as a response to the growing magnitude of cybercrime in the world. Although nations are not yet fully conversant with cybersecurity the evolution of cyber law has helped ensure the privacy and security of businesses and organizations across the internet. Intercontinental cyber laws are destined for the near future whereby multiple nations will merge their sovereign laws in efforts to reduce the preponderance and scale of cyberattacks. In the U.S. alone the following legislative acts have already been passed: The CAN-SPAM ACT regards unsolicited emailing in relation to fraud activities The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act protects users from fraud and abuse The Electronic Communication Privacy Act prohibits an unauthorized third party from intercepting or disclosing communications The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act made identity theft an official federal crime The Trade Secrets Acts provides American companies with federal protection against and remediation for the misappropriation of important propriety information What's Next? The same advanced technology used for cybersecurityîincluding machine-learning and AI toolsîare employed by today's cybercriminals too. So staying one step ahead of them is an ongoing challenge. Preparing for the next generation of cybercrime requires users to become vigilant about which types of attacks are in the wildîand clearly understand how to defended themselves against these threats. Successful approaches to cybersecurity will include multi-prong defenses. And it will involve service providers and third-party expertise even for organizations large enough to employ comprehensive cybersecurity technology and expert staff in-house. What every organization needs to battle cybercrime today as well as tomorrow is a security operations center.  Question: Give your thoughts on New Technology Brings New Crimeù.

Mrs B's ability to bathe dress use the toilet and eat meals remained steady at the level of requiring some assistance with planning and organising (motivating?) while able to complete the fine and gross motor tasks (praxis) without physical assistance. Mrs B. is planning to go home to the hostel (low care aged care facilityù) section of the retirement community where she had previously had an assisted living apartment. Her constipation dehydration and poor nutrition resolved in hospital. Her cognition improved now scoring 26/30 on the MMSE with mild deficits in short term recall orientation f4tlate and a couple of minor errors in the language tests. Her hypothyroidism was corrected. Her BP was stable in hospital so her antihypertensive was ceased (she hadn't been taking it regularly when she was unwell at home). She responded well to anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medication. Over time Mrs B gradually became more responsive and more engaged with recreational pursuits with some encouragement. She expressed no more thoughts of dying and was perplexed (embarrassed?) when asked about her previous expression of these thoughts. Her appetite and sleep stabilised. Episodes of anxiety were less frequent.  1. What could be done to assist the son emotionally and practically? 2. How might you interact with Mrs B. when she is anxious? 3.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/06/hrmn300-human-resource-management-diversity-and-multiculturalism-2/,What are some of the organizational benefits of attracting and retaining a culturally diverse workforce? There are several organizational benefits for attracting and retaining a culturally diverse workforce. Companies have learned that their employees should represent their customers. All companies sell their products and services to an increasingly diverse population. Thus the employee makeup of the firm should also be diverseù. Portolese Dias states We can better communicate with one another and customers. With a multicultural perspective we can create better ideas and solutions.ù Diversity provides a variety of views perspectives skills and experiences. A better reputation is built within the organization as well as with customers. A diverse workforce increases employee satisfaction this results in an increase of productivity creativity and loyalty. How can diversity support an organization's talent management strategy? Attracting diverse talent will attract more diverse talent increasing the overall success of the organization. Requirements for a Diverse and Inclusive Culture states Framing diversity as policy provides necessary clarity.ù The article continues with This approach can also help leaders design an employee experience that continually promotes performance for a multigenerational multiracial and multibackground workforce.ù  You not only recognize that employees are different but that those differences are a strength for the organization. With a diverse background the organization experiences enhanced collaboration and communication receiving inputs from a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences. Author Portolese Dias states that diversity can help us with policies to prevent discrimination avoiding legal repercussions. How can multiculturalism support an organization's talent management strategy? Portolese Dias says that multiculturalism can help us gain a deeper understanding of the differences between people. A focus on multiculturalism can help an organization avoid power derived from race social class gender or sexual orientation privileges. The author continues by explaining The culture of the company and the way the organization operates can contribute to the nurturing of a multicultural environment (or not).ù  If recruiters and human resources apply multiculturalism it creates a positive work culture drawing more diverse and skilled candidates to the organization. Multiculturalism can also provide cultures races and ethnicities with the opportunity to advance within an organization. This shows employees that there is a fair chance for all to grow that the same opportunities exist and that fair treatment exists for all. Once again this creates a positive public perception and attracts more talent. What policies would you develop as an HRM to ensure your organization achieves these benefits? As an HRM a policy I would implement would be enhanced training for diversity multiculturalism and inclusion. Employees who are educated about the benefits of a diverse workforce can help create a culture of acceptance. It may be possible to implement a new hiring strategy as well. When a candidate is forwarded to a decision maker the name and ethnicities should be redacted.  This could help avoid invisible bias and ensure the best candidate is selected. I wouldn't make it mandatory but I would also welcome employee feedback and input for ways to ensure fairness and to avoid bias. An anonymous feedback system could be used by HRM to ensure policies are being followed. The company I have chosen that exhibits a stellar commitment to their diversity program is 3M. 3M has developed diversity goals to be met by 2025. 3M created a Diversity & Inclusion Council. The council is made up of leaders across the globe that focus on enhancing and prioritizing actions to create an inclusive workplace. The Catalyst CEO Champion for Change pledge was signed by 3M's CEO which is a nonprofit that helps build workplaces for women. 3M has joined the United Nations Women's Empowerment Principles and the United Nations LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business. 3M also created Employee Resource Networks so employees from communities can network communicate and build leadership skills. These networks include the African American network disAbility Awareness network A3ACTION Latino Resource network Military Support network Native American network and Women's Leadership Forum. 3M's workforce diversity is currently 42.1%. 3M has achieved 90% pay equity for employees across the globe and 100% for the United States. They have expressed that their goal is to reach 100% pay equity globally. 3M has invested $50 million to study and address racial opportunity gaps in the Unites States. 75% of employees say they feel included at 3M. 3M is currently pursuing goals which include reaching 65% for global diversity in management and doubling the representation of minorities in the U.S.    Read less,HRMN300 Human Resource Management : Diversity and Multiculturalism

This assignment is submitted using SafeAssign. Save your Word document file with your name unit name and assessment number included (e.g. Jane Doe IAS201 A3). Ensure you have your name student number and page number in the footer of your document and the title of the assignment in the header. Introduction: It has been argued that cultural capabilities are fundamental to operating effectively in the workplace community and the university. Cultural capabilities are required for creating safe work and learning spaces. So to complete this task you will be drawing together all of the learning from the unit to show understanding of strategies to create safe spaces. Instructions for IAS 201: You are to watch and analyse all THREE videos linked below; Too Strong For You Karen (on YouTube) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR2d23LM4eo (formally titled MilduraMcDonald's franchisee filmed claiming his neighbour is not a òtrue Aboriginal' | ABC News) Dirt Cheap 30 Years on: the story of uranium mining in Kakadu (on Vimeo) https://vimeo.com/73373709 (specifically the first 34 minutes) Coronavirus: Doctor verbally abused in racist attack | Nine News Australia (YouTube) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiUZtQCVODs 1 Select at minimum 5 (but you can use more) of the 7 following concepts 2 IAS 201 students are required to use Generative Interactions as 1 of their 5 (or more) concepts 3 each video should have a different concept(s) applied to it 4 no concept should be used more than once. 5 Use 2 additional outside scholarly texts you find through the library (for example another text about equity to support your analysis of equity). 1. Recognizing White/Racial/Settler Privilege (McIntosh or Gilio-Whitaker) 2. Identifying Bias (Kandola) 3. Power Relations (Cummins) 4. Generative Interactions required (Bernstein et al.) 5. Equity and Equity Literacy (Gorski) 6. Cultural Border Crossings/Cultural Valence (Smolicz et al.) 7. Cultural Safety (Bin-Sallik) or Safe Spaces (Harless) Again you will need to supplement your analysis with 2 additional outside scholarly texts you find through the CDU library (for example another text about bias to support your analysis) Task: Write a formal report to observe and analyse whether characters in each of the three video interactions are showing effective cultural capabilities and maintaining a culturally safe space. Also recommend how effective cultural capabilities of the people involved could be improved. For this paper you will need to use AT MINIMUM five in class texts and two additional scholarly texts (that you find through the university library search engine. Partner Option: You have the option of working with a partner. However if you choose to do this you must apply all seven (7) concepts above (2 different concepts applied to each video) in your paper (& again using Generative Interactions is required). In this sense the work is divided since the word limit is the same but each of you are still required to apply at least 3 or 4 concepts each. Plus the 2 additional outside scholarly texts (1 each per person). Task details The report should: Summarise and describe observations of the interactions related to aspects of cultural capabilities in the interaction. Analyse (with formal references) the safe and unsafe aspects of the interaction including the physical location and interactions between people. Provide recommendations for creating or sustaining this interaction as a culturally safe space. Once you submit the report you will need to write a minimum 250-word (275 words max) reflection. Answering the following prompts. No citations are needed for this reflection just name the author if applicable. Submitted separately and individually. 1. Think about your academic focus and professional aspirations (Education Nursing Midwifery Pysch IT Science etc.) and briefly discuss how you can apply the content and concepts you have learned in this unit to your respective profession. What issues and challenges exist in your field regarding culture (how your profession treats the public or it can be the culture/climate within your profession and how they treat one another) and how can you address said issue(s) with what you have learned in this course? 2. Harless (2018) says that Breaching a student's intellectual safety is in fact crucial to his or her growthù (p. 333). So with that in mind what topic/reading in this course offered you the most intellectual growth? And what about it stimulated you and broadened your understanding?

Hannah first started working as a nursery nurse but after witnessing the care and compassion provided to a family member after a stroke decided to come and work in social care. She started working as a domiciliary care worker in a small family-owned business and has since progressed through a number of managerial roles to become a head of care services. She's now part of a development team overseeing the building of a new care service to support people with dementia.   She's never studied management or leadership and she is both worried and excited about a new project where she is involved in the design and planning of a new facility to support 30 people with dementia in a specialist dementia suite and 49 extra care apartments for those in need of extra care. She will be working closely with the architects and various tradespeople and will soon be recruiting the wide range of staff needed: carers administration and reception maintenance domestic and catering.

Hannah really enjoys managing a team and is very motivated to develop team members in their roles but she realises that she needs to gain a deep insight and understanding of leadership related to her new project. She decides to write a 4000-word formal business style report for her team that highlights those aspects of leadership relevant to project to ensure that there is a shared understanding and context of leadership and teams. The report will address the following areas:   1. Examine the role of leadership in leading teams.  2. Analyse the value of using theoretical models relevant to when building a successful team.  3. Explain the stages of team development and the leadership style at each stage to achieve a successful project outcome.  4.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/08/mgmt5710-managing-and-leading-people/,I need you please to write one page reflection about one subject in the article which is ù The GROW Model ù .Please first 3 lines of the page contain a summary about the section which is The GROW Modelù and the rest I need it a reflection from your opinion.  The GROW Model One of the best ways to get better at nondirective coaching is to try conversing using the GROW model devised in the 1980s by Sir John Whitmore and others. GROW involves four action steps the first letters of which give the model its name. It's easy to grasp conceptually but it's harder to practice than you might imagine because it requires training yourself to think in new ways about what your role and value are as a leader. The four action steps are these: When you begin discussing a topic with someone you're coaching establish exactly what he wants to accomplish right now. Not what his goals are for the project or his job or his role in the organization but what he hopes to get out of this particular exchange. People don't do this organically in most conversations and they often need help with it. A good way to start is to ask something like What do you want when you walk out the door that you don't have now?ù With the goal of your conversation established ask questions rooted in what when where and who each of which forces people to come down out of the clouds and focus on specific facts. This makes the conversation real and constructive. You'll notice that we didn't include why. That's because asking why demands that people explore reasons and motivations rather than facts. In doing that it can carry overtones of judgment or trigger attempts at self-justification both of which can be counterproductive. During this stage a good reality-focused question to ask is What are the key things we need to know?ù Attend carefully to how people respond. Are they missing something important? Are they talking about operational issues but forgetting the human side of the equation? Or the reverse? When you ask people to slow down and think in this way they often lose themselves in contemplationîand then a light comes on and off they go engaging with the problem on their own with new energy and a fresh perspective. This step is critical because it stops people from overlooking pertinent variables and leaping to conclusions. Your job here is just to raise the right questions and then get out of the way. When people come to you for coaching they often feel stuck. There's nothing I candoù they might tell you. Or I have only one real option.ù Or I'm torn between A and B.ù At this point your task is to help them think more broadly and more deeply. To broaden the conversation sometimes it's enough to ask something as simple as If you had a magic wand what would you do?ù You'd be surprised how freeing many people find that question to beîand how quickly they then start thinking in fresh productive ways. Once they've broadened their perspective and discovered new options your job is to prompt them to deepen their thinking perhaps by encouraging them to explore the upside the downside and the risks of each option.

Students are to answer all seven (7) questions. Answers are expected to total 1400 words +/- 10% words above this limit will not be marked. Suggested number of words for each answer is provided in the rubric. Answers need to be supported by current credible research with intext citations where appropriate. Case Study Scenario Edith a 77-year-old lady presented to the emergency department (ED) via ambulance after falling in her home. On assessment Edith does not have any fall related injurie other than a minor graze on her left elbow. Edith appears slightly confused and is asking for Margaret her daughter. When contacted Margaret attends the ED department and informs staff that Edith's local doctor recently identified Edith as recently been experiencing dementia most probably due to Alzheimer's disease. Margaret states that Edith does not appear more confused than normal. Given this the ED team do not suspect a potential alternative diagnosis of delirium. Social History Edith is a widow of five years lives in her own home with minimal support from Margaret. Edith is relatively independent. She still drives a car she self-regulates by not driving at night and only driving to her local shops a friend's house and her GP when needed. At the shops Edith pays for her groceries with larger notes as she seems unclear of how much to pass to the cashier. She became lost on the way home from the shops last week and was upset as she could not recognise where she was. After an hour she found her way home. Margaret gave her mother a mobile phone for just this type of emergency but Edith cannot understand which buttons to push and finds using the mobile phone frustrating. NRSG266 _ Assessment Three: Case Study _ Semester Two 2021 _ Page 3 of 5 Margaret is worried that Edith may not be eating as well as she used to and at 48kgs has lost 10kgs over the past 2 years. Margaret brings four or five frozen home cooked meals which she leaves in Edith's freezer. Edith used to be a very good cook. She is famous for her elaborate birthday cakes. These days she has lost interest in cooking. Margaret visited Edith last week and found five meals still in Edith's freezer. Edith has forgotten how to use the microwave and did not want to ask for help. Edith has been more forgetful over recent months misplacing her purse and car keys only to find them in the oven. Margaret says her mother is afraid someone will rob her so she sometimes puts her purse in odd paces them cannot find it. Edith arrives hours early for appointments and sometimes on the wrong date. Edith hides her inability to understand time by saying she likes to be early. Edith is generally a social lady visiting her friend twice a week at 10 am on Tuesdays and Fridays. Conversations are getting more difficult as Edith is slow to find the right word. Last week she drove to her friend at four in the morning thinking she might be late. Medical History AMI  10 years ago currency in rate controlled AF. Bilateral cataract extraction and insertion of IOL's  8 years ago required maintaining her driving licence.

Daily (general health  in particular Thiamine supplementation) Paracetamol 1gram no more than 6hourly as needed. End of Scenario Answer the following seven (7) questions. Use evidence based literature to support answers where appropriate. All information not your own original thought must be referenced. For each answer you must demonstrate person centred care by including reference to Edith's circumstances where required. Question 1 Edith requires a physical assessment in the ED. Provide evidence based person centred (ie Edith) rationales for each assessment provided below. ECG Respiratory Ax Skin Ax Mini cognitive assessment NRSG266 _ Assessment Three: Case Study _ Semester Two 2021 _ Page 4 of 5 (suggest 150-200 words) Question 2 Edith has presented with dementia most likely in the context of Alzheimer's Disease. List six 6 signs and symptoms of early Alzheimer's disease which Edith is experiencing. For each sign and symptom provide detailed data from scenario to support your answer. Provide your answer in a table belowQuestion 3 The medical team perform further testing to rule out any potentially reversible cause of Edith's dementia. Edith undergoes various tests to exclude other possible contributing pathology. The medical team send Edith for a brain perfusion scan also called a SPECT (single-photon emission computerised topography).

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/08/mba637-operations-and-supply-chain-management-system/,The World Health Organization defines health technologies as  the application of organized knowledge and skills in the form of medicines medical devices vaccines procedures and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of life.ù Home health care is a wide range of health care services that can be given in your home for an illness or injury. Home health care is usually less expensive more convenient and just as effective as care you get in a hospital or skilled nursing facility (Medicare 2021). For people with mobility issues getting to appointments can be challenging. Staying in the home for appointments is one way to eliminate this issue. This is because it means that patients don't need to worry about getting to and from places to receive the treatment that they need. Home health care is it allows family to be present during the visit. This keeps family members in the loop when it comes to the treatment of the patient and it can ease the nerves of the patient by having someone they trust in the room (BetterPT 2020). A great example of home health care is the UAB House Calls Program. The program was founded in 2015 and serves home-bound patients who live within a 40-mile radius of UAB. In March 2021 the program started administering the COVID-19 vaccine to their patients and their patients' care givers. From March-August the team administered approximately 400 vaccines (UAB 2021). The demand for Remote Patient Monitoring and wearables is expected to grow from $745 million in 2020 to 1.7 billion by 2027 (Dunskiy). These devices can improve quality of care by tracking patient conditions such as activity levels blood pressure blood glucose oxygen saturation and other useful vital signs. However these wearable devices do more than just track patients' symptoms  they also help reduce readmission rates. These wearable devices can be linked directly to a patient's records allowing quick and easy access by clinicians and doctors allowing medical personnel to make key decisions about treatment in real time. Doctors can use the real time monitoring to make educated decisions about health symptoms. Researchers estimate that Remote Patient Monitoring and wearables will save nearly $200 Billion dollars over the next 25 years (Greenspun Korba and Bandyopadhyay). In a Vivalink survey 64% of patients over the age of 40 said they would wear a remote medical device if it reduced the amount of physical medical visits (VivaLink). Nearly half of the US population takes prescription medications and 24% of those take 3 or more medications (Dunskiy). Remote patient monitoring and wearables allow for reminders monitor medication uptakes and data to make sure meds are taken properly and work properly. When discussing new technologies telemedicine has had many positive effects on healthcare operational excellence. According to the CDC telemedicine is described as the use of electronic information and telecommunication technology to get the health care you need while practicing social distancing. Telemedicine care includes many types of care such as COVID- 19 screening mental health counseling and general healthcare including- wellness visits and blood pressure control. One of its positive effects is increased revenue for practices. Video visits allow providers to see more patients in the same period of time. In conclusion we believe that new technologies and healthcare delivery alternatives have a positive effect on healthcare operational excellence. Student response to Team 2: (Jennifer A. response) (Respond regarding to what they say they learned) Team 2 great presentation I agree with you all 100% that new technologies have a positive effect on healthcare. I currently work with patients who have benefited from one or more of the technologies that you all presented. UAB house calls is a wonderful program that I wish other hospitals would implement. Many of our patients have benefitted from having direct medical care in their homes when they do not have the means to get to a medical facility for treatment. Another topic you guys touched on was telemedicine. This option for many in my patient population has had a huge impact on reducing rehospitalizations. Again so many patients are not able to get to their appointments or just don't follow through because of the hassle of going to an appointment or the cost of the copay. During the pandemic many insurance companies even waived telehealth copays to help ensure patients were utilizing this feature to get the care and follow-up needed. Remote patient monitoring is another great feature that I agree will be huge in the coming years. The real-time data that is sent to doctors for monitoring patients is helping with keeping patients healthier and out of the hospital and is also reducing medical costs. You guys hit on some amazing points and I really enjoyed all you had to say during your presentation.    Team 7: Conù (Disagrees with the topic) New Technologies and Healthcare Delivery Alternatives Will Have a Positive Effect on Healthcare Operational Excellenceù  Team 7 Summary (Con) In the digital age it is our natural inclination to believe new technology is generally a good thing. However new technologies come with new challenges. In the healthcare industry new technologies and processes are exciting but at what cost? New technologies and healthcare delivery alternatives lead to a loss in the human factor of medicine disruption in treatment and an over-reliance on technology. Ultimately despite the hopeful nature of advancementù new does not necessarily equal better. The operational goal of any business or institution is to provide a satisfactory product or service to the consumer in this case satisfactory healthcare to patients. Due to new tech and delivery alternatives patients do not receive the healthcare they need thus leading to an overall negative impact on healthcare operational excellence. One of the most important aspects of healthcare is the human factor that being the interaction between healthcare provider and patient. This is not just on a personal level; the simple act of being present in a healthcare institution increases the likelihood of favorable healthcare outcomes. Patient safety and care continuity are set aside in favor of convenience and efficiency. As for healthcare providers tried and true practices are exchanged for modernization often leaving them undertrained and without the necessary knowledge to perform effectively. This leads to varying levels of readiness and acceptance among providers (Zhang Mosier and Subbian 2021). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic telehealth (phone calls video conferences etc.) has become significantly more common. Telehealth has been shown to increase the likelihood of misdiagnoses potentially putting patients in danger (Abbott et al. 2016). Furthermore patients are unable to get blood drawn labs run or other procedures that require presence in a healthcare facility. While this clearly puts the patient in potential danger ultimately the fallout will reach the hospital resulting in costly and lengthy malpractice lawsuits. Other technologies such as 3D printing (primarily for prosthetics and potentially new organs) are new and inconsistent. This is typically done with limited products that are bad for the environment and projects can often turn out inconsistent and poor (Matthews 2019). When new technologies become integral to healthcare operations providers can depend on them too heavily leading to data breaches and potential system shutdowns. Such has happened before like with Sunnylake Hospital. Sunnylake's online healthcare system was breached and held at ransom with the information of patients and the hospitals functions at stake. This disrupted their ability to provide healthcare to their patients even inhibiting their ability to provide surgeries for a short period (Eisenmann 2009). These types of IT failures can be catastrophic costing healthcare providers money and preventing patients from getting adequate care. Overall new technology and healthcare delivery methods still have a lot of challenges to overcome. While there are benefits to digitizing and finding new efficient ways to provide healthcare we simply do not have a way to account for the downfalls. With the issues of depersonalization disruptive technology and over-reliance on technology still plaguing healthcare providers today this on balance has a negative effect on healthcare operational excellence. Great job! I loved your statement in your essay One of the most important aspects of healthcare is the human factor that being the interaction between healthcare provider and patient.ù Although I do agree with this statement I do believe there are some positive effects that technology can have on healthcare. We still have a lot to learn when it comes to modern medicine and it seems as long as both elements of humanity and technology are considered better medical decisions can be made for the patients.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/09/acct106-managerial-accounting-and-financial-performance/,A great deal of research has been carried out on corporate reputation as measured by members on Fortune's list. Our paper looks at how CSR performance contributes to a firm's reputation although other research has focused on the behavior of those on the list. For example Haleblian et al. (2017) found that high reputation firms (i.e. those on the Fortune Most Admired list) engage in more acquisitions. These authors also found that investors in these firms hold higher expectations. Therefore when investors were unhappy with these acquisitions their stock was more negatively affected. Turning to our measure of reputation significant research has shown that corporate financial performance (CFP) is the largest contributing factor to membership on Fortune's Most Admired Companies list even though it is not directly used as a criterion formembership. In fact early research showed that CFP was able to explain 84 per cent of the variance in membership (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). Their study showed that the nine criteria that survey participants use to determine industry ranking load primarily on a single factor with all questions somehow related to CFP. To resolve this unidimensionality problem Fryxell and Wing (1994) performed confirmatory factor analyses on three models  the single factor model implied by Fombrun and Shanley (i.e. CFP) a two-factor model and a dominant factorù model. The single factor solution allowed all eight items to load on a single factor as found in the original work (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). These authors also performed a confirmatory factor analysis on a twofactor model. They began by loading three financial measures (long-term investment value financial soundness and use of corporate assets) on a financial ends factor while the other five factors (innovation people management social responsibility quality of management and quality of products/services) were forced to load on a factor they called capabilities and strategic means.ù Although the elements of capabilities and strategic means had better factor loadings on this different factor this two-factor model was rejected on the grounds of poor discriminant validity due the correlation between the two factors (0.971). These authors then created a hybrid model (i.e. a dominant factor model) that forced four of the capability elements to load on a dominant financial factor believing that these capabilities led to increased profitability and thereby membership on the Most Admired list. These four capability elements (quality of management quality of product/service innovativeness and talent management) were also combined into a subordinated meansù factor. The element community and environmental responsibilityù was added only to the subordinated means factor. It was this third model that produced the best validity. Ultimately however the authors still believed that financial performance was the key driver of membership on the Fortune Most Admired list. In other words using only financial measures would be sufficient to predict membership on the list. Even though it confirmed the impact of financial performance on reputation this research does show that reputation can also be impacted by factors outside of CFP. While our research focuses on CSR behavior the public's perception of a CEO will also influence a company's membership on the Most Admired list. In fact CEO behavior is critical to engagement in CSR activities. Researchers have found that higher CEO prominence in the media leads to a higher reputation (Love et al. 2017). This effect is magnified depending on whether the media tenor is negative or positive. This research also found that CEO awards make it more likely that a firm will become one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies. We believe that our research fits nicely with these findings since CSR behavior is likely to drive CEO awards and the tenor and amount of coverage in the press. Scholars have examined how CSR behavior affects a firm's financial performance. Peiris and Evans (2010) observed a positive relationship between CSR and CFP particularly community relations employment conditions and environmental standards. Peiro-Signes et al. (2013) observed that CSR behaviors measured by ESG factors significantly contribute to financial performance although the effects were moderated by market-to-book ratio return on assets and company size. Companies that engage in more CSR behaviors have been found to have higher revenue per employee and cash flow per share when compared to companies near the industry median (Flanagan et al. 2011). Other research has shown that when a company's CSR is proactively monitored and managed a company is more successful financially (Baumgartner 2014). In addition an analysis of over 2500 international firms listed on both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the Global Vantage database found that companies that are deemed sustainable (high levels of CSR) reap higher valuation within the marketplace (Yu and Zhao 2015). Other research has modeled CSR as an insurance policy against negative publicity or bad acts (Brammer and Pavelin 2005). Lankoski (2008) claimed that CSR outcomes lead directly to reputation because reputation is the only way for many stakeholders to learn about CSR behavior. This reputational improvement then leads to increases in financial performance. there is considerable research that makes the connection between financial performance and Most Admired status. The positive correlation between CSR behavior and a firm's value demonstrates that leaders in performance and execution of these efforts outperform others and receive a premium in their stock price. In this paper however we want to determine whether CSR behavior can affect changes in corporate reputation beyond their contribution to financial performance. Because of the increases in SRI and the focus by companies on the release of sustainability reports we offer the following propositions: P1. Positive CSR behavior will increase the likelihood of a firm becoming a Most Admired Company. P2. Negative CSR behavior will decrease the likelihood of a firm becoming a Most Admired Company.

For example an article from HR Magazine or CareerBuilder that discusses how to reduce turnover would not be appropriate. Instead a news story about Lyft's high turnover last quarter is a better choice because it requires you to be the examiner and analyst. Required Elements ¢ the gap between what actually happened and the expected HRM principle or best practice. ¢ the contributing factors and/or reasons you think the situation occurred. ¢ the steps you would take to prevent this occurring in the future. Be sure to clearly address these three elements and in your discussion use your textbook assupport for your argument and/or recommendation.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/09/bus501-strategic-management-foods-retailing-industry/,You are a consultant hired to help TJ to maintain and improve its performance in the foods retailing industry. Please present your recommendations to ensure this objective while ensuring that you answer the following questions: Although the TJ CEO has left the assignment somewhat open to interpretation he has made it clear that he wants to be able to use the final report to better understand the firm's past performance and future prospects. Therefore the final report should address (but not necessarily be limited to) the following questions: 1.How attractive is the Food Retailing Industry? Defend your answer with a detailed analysis of the industry. (25).  2.How do the data provided in Exh. 2 of the case help you identify better the strategies of different firms in the industry and more broadly help you understand better how grocery firms make money and reward their shareholders? (5) 3.How would you describe TJ's' strategy? What is your evaluation of their strategy? What if any competitive advantages do they enjoy? (50) 4.What do you see as the most significant opportunities and threats facing TJ at the conclusion of the period described in the case as they look into the future ? (10) 5.Going forward what recommendations would you suggest be made to TJ' strategy to help the firm to navigate through these opportunities and threats? (10) Use the attached case class notes class slides and the textbook Understanding MIchel Porter by Joan Magretta (TEXTBOOK LINK: https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B005OVTMAY ) to complete the final report paper. In preparing the paper you may of course use exhibits to support your arguments or conclusions. The results of the application of various analytical tools for example are appropriate for exhibits. You may use as many exhibits as you deem necessary. Be sure to refer to each exhibit in the relevant places in the paper. Some general guidelines: 1)  The main analysis can be up to 4 single-spaced pages in 12 pitch font. Please do not exceed this page limit for the main text. No separate executive summary is required. Appendices exhibits if any can be additional. 2)  3)  Focus on analysis not description. Think of the exam response as a Consultant's Report that you would provide to the CEO of the featured company treating them as a client. For instance you don't need to give the CEO an extended introduction to what the company does and essentially repeat case facts. Presumably she/he knows that. Focus on the implications of things. 4)  Pay close attention to the assigned questions and ensure that you answer them all.  5)  I do not look for any single correct answerù or solutionù. Instead I will look at each report as a self contained document and analyze it on its logical consistency and depth and breadth in addressing the relevant issues. Your recommendations should be supported by persuasive and logically consistent arguments and data where available.    Read less,BUS501 Strategic Management : Foods Retailing Industry

However different media sources can present very different viewpoints on such issues and not all of these viewpoints are scientifically balanced. Workers in environmental fields must be able to critique media reports in order to strategize and construct effective public messaging.  2. This assignment gives you an opportunity to develop your analytical skills in identifying the tactics perspectives and viewpoints about climate change presented in the media. Instructions Select a variety of current media about climate change that address at least one of the following questions: Is climate change really happening? Is climate change natural or caused by humans? How can climate change be most effectively addressed?  3. Begin by gathering relevant articles on this topic from a variety of media sources such as newspapers magazines government brochures/leaflets corporate websites environmental group publications and so on. Look for recent publications and assemble a variety of media clippings; choose as many different viewpoints perspectives and tactics as you canîyour goal will be to find six articles that best demonstrate this disparity. In particular try to find provocative clippings.  4. Environmental issues can stir a lot of emotions and sometimes people vent. There is also a lot of misinformation out there. If you can find clippings that exemplify this you will have a much easier time with the analysis for this assignment. From your research select six clippings that represent the widest variety of sources and viewpoints that you can find and prepare a written analysis and report on them. Begin with a 200300-word introduction that summarizes your media analysis/findings.  5. Do not summarize the content of the clipping. Instead for each item: Give the title author and source of the article/clipping (include a URL or link to the item or attach a copy of the article to your report for your tutor). In one or two short sentences identify the author's viewpoint or position on climate change. (Is the author for or against the issue? Both for it and against it? Neither for it nor against it? Or is the viewpoint unclear?)  6. Discuss the author's perspective (that is how the author approaches the issue) which may be an economic perspective a social perspective a political perspective an ecological/scientific perspective a religious perspective or other. Provide a sample from the clipping to support your claim. Explain in detail the tactics the author uses to convince you that her/his position is right and give samples from the article to illustrate this.  7. You can identify the same tactic twice across your six media sources as long as you have one appropriate and one inappropriate example (that is one where the author uses the tactic appropriately and one where they do not). This should be the longest part of your clipping analysis.  8. When analyzing the tactics think about how language is used. How are facts presented? Are they supported or are the opinions masked as facts? How can you tell? Has the author used language to attack someone instead of that person's message? What about statistics? How have these been used or critiqued?    Read less,ENVS 243 Environmental Studies  Climate change natural or caused

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/09/soc445-social-research-methods-the-research-design-process/,The purpose of this project is to gain an understanding of the research design process so that you can undertake social scientific research in an appropriate manner. For this paper you are to complete a research paper that focuses on a public administration or public policy topic.   The subject matter is up to you but you need to start with a clearly defined research question. Research questions focus on asking what factors explain a certain phenomenon. The following are all examples of research questions:  1.) What explains variation in crime rates across states? 2.) What factors explain differences in voter turnout for municipal elections? 3.) Why do some people support the legalization of marijuana and others do not? Once you have a properly stated research question you can proceed with researching and writing the actual paper.  Good research papers have structure. Most include the following components: an introduction a literature review a section for the description of data and methods a section for an analysis of the results of the study and a conclusion where the implications of the research findings are discussed.  Given the quick pace of this course (and more importantly since you are still learning statistical methods) I do not expect you to collect and analyze data for this project. That is something you can do in later courses. However I do expect for you to be able to set up the research design for an investigation.  Accordingly this project should include the following components:  \uf0a7 Introduction  o Introduce the topic of the study to the reader o Formally state your research question and o Explain why the topic is worthy of study.  \uf0a7 Literature Review o Research your chosen topic to see what other scholars have found vis-†-vis your research question (using books academic articles newspaper articles etc.) and o Write a summary of what other researchers have found using appropriate citations.  \uf0a7 Data and Methods  o Find a source of data (secondary data) that can be used to answer your research question and describe it or if none are available explain how you would collect the necessary data (e.g. create a survey collect administrative data etc.) o Clearly state what your units of analysis are (e.g. individuals states countries etc.)  o Formally state what your dependent variable is and how you intend to measure it o Formally state what your independent variables are and how you intend to measure them o Generate at least two (2) testable hypotheses and o Explain what type of statistical analysis is appropriate for the data that you intend to use and explain why.  \uf0a7 Summary  o Reflect on your research design by briefly summarizing the previous steps taken. o (In a formal research report you would have sections for an analysis of your results and a formal conclusion. However since this is just a research design project you do not have to worry about those sections here.)    Read less,SOC445 Social Research Methods: The Research Design Process

Just don't pick something that you've already seen being actively marketed. For example after completing a SWOT analysis for McDonald's one might propose marketing new concepts like a McVeggie burger or an adult happy meal. Further afield one might propose a whole new chain of pay-to-visit indoor McPlayground Centers. Or relative to existing menu offerings one might suggest a dedicated marketing campaign for say burgers at breakfastù or after midnight snacking via the drive-through. Learn about your brand and then let your imagination run wild. It can be a big idea that will appeal to many of their customers or a very targeted effortîyou decide.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/09/laws200-business-organisationsfumigation-business/,Question 1 Trinity Pty Ltd (TPL) runs a confectionary business. Anusha Borden Colleen Dennis and Emily are directors in the company. In recent times the company premises have been infested with rats. To deal with the rat problem the board passed a resolution to fix the problem and agreed that the job be given out urgently through a tender process. Felicia the Facilities Manager was assigned the task of receiving the tenders and presenting the same to the board for final approval. Felicia provided a copy of the job description to Gregory her partner who is in the fumigation business. Gregory read through it and began to work on lodging a tender for the job. A week later Felicia returns home with all the tenders and leaves them in an unsealed envelope on the kitchen slab. When Gregory returns home he notices an envelope on the kitchen slab and opens it. He reads through all the tenders and decides to adjust his tender based on the information from the other tenders. The next morning he hands Felicia his tender. When Felicia presented all the tenders to the board they unanimously agreed to go with Gregory's tender. Another person who had placed a tender has reported to one of the Directors' (Anusha) that he heard Gregory boasting that he got the job due to insider information from his wife. He said I had direct access to all the tenders; I read them and doctored my tender to be better than the others.ù The board is disappointed and angry with Felicia and has confronted her about the situation and the possible breach of several duties of directors. Felicia responded that she is not one of the directors and therefore cannot be in breach of directors' duties. She also denies providing any privileged information to her partner Gregory. She mentioned that she informed him about the tender the same way she informed others but she did not provide him with inside information. The premise was eventually fumigated and this appeared to resolve the problem. Three months after the fumigation customers have reported seeing rat droppings in their bread. The business is having to shut down and the board is worried about its ability to meet its credit obligations. Already they have overdue taxes that the company cannot pay. Emily offered to settle all the outstanding obligations and suggested that TPL should go into the pesticide business. She advised that the current business location be split in two  one side for confectionaries the other for the pesticide business. She said from her experience of over 15 years as a scientist rats are rarely found in premises running pesticide businessù. The plan is that after about 6 months the confectionary business would recommence operations and that by then the rat problem will be history. The board is worried about investing in another business at a time when they are struggling with meeting their financial obligations. The board deliberated on the business idea for a long time and based on Emily's expert opinion and persuasiveness they decided to take on the risk. It's now six months since they began running the pesticide business and unfortunately it is not yielding meaningful returns. For the last five months they have been unable to pay Clean Pesticide Pty Ltd (CPP) the agreed payments for monthly supplies of raw materials. CPP has threatened to bring an action against the directors for insolvent trading. 1. Please advise the board whether Felicia is in breach of any directors' duties. 15 Marks 2. The directors of TPL are seeking your advice as to the likelihood of success against them in an insolvent trading action and if any defences are available to them? 10 marks Question 2 Crown Cross Limited (CCL) is a listed company trying to raise $50m for a new project. CCL is owed $10m by MC Hammer Pty Ltd (MCH). Payment of this sum may mean CCL would not need the merger but the directors are not willing to bring an action against MCH. To raise the $50 million CCL has agreed to a merger with JC Coins Pty Ltd (JCC). The merger terms require the removal of 3 CCL directors the appointment of 3 JCC Directors and the re-acquisition of the shares of members with less than 2.5% ordinary shares. The board has agreed to all the terms and will seek the requisite approvals at the next annual general meeting. Only 3 of over 600 members in CCL is impacted by the re-acquisition decision. The terms for re-acquisition are very generous well over the current market value. Two of the three shareholders are happy with the generous offer but the third shareholder (Belmont) is disappointed and opposes the re-acquisition. Belmont is angry with the board for not bringing an action against MCH and for seeking to re-acquire his shares. He believes if the $10 million debt is paid the merger won't be necessary. He has therefore decided to bring an action against MCH on behalf of the company and to take action against the company for the proposed re-acquisition of his shares. CCL has decided to hold its AGM on 30 November 2021 at 10 am at the Crown Hotel Melbourne. It intends among other things to discuss the reduction of the remunerations paid to directors due to the impact of COVID the new project for which $50 million is required the merger with JCC and the re-acquisition of shares of members with less than 2.5% ordinary shares. 1. Please draft a notice of the Annual General Meeting. 5 marks 2. Please advise CCL a. whether it can re-acquire the shares of members with less than 2.5% ordinary shares and b. the procedure for the re-acquisition of those shares. 5 Marks 3. Please advise Belmont on the remedies available to him as a member and his likelihood of success. 10 Marks Questions 3 Spin Off Piper Pty Ltd (SOP) is a cruise shipping company that has been in business for over 60 years. In January 2021 SOP was found negligent for not following the rules and fined $25 million. Due to SOP's inability to pay the debt it filed for voluntary winding up on 31 January 2021. On 10 March 2021 Bruce was appointed as the liquidator. On 27 February 2021 Chloe a director in the company sold one of the company vehicles (A Ferrari) worth $1.3 million to her partner for $10000.

This assignment requires you to answer the following question in no more than 2500 words: òThe question of employment status  whether an employee a worker or an independent contractor  remains an area of debate. Determining status ‚ for employment rights involves considering a range of factors. The Uber  decision has not changed that. Indeed it places emphasis on the importance of considering the facts rather than the contract. The importance of considering all the facts means that the Uber decision will not necessarily mean that individuals engaged with other service platforms must also be workers. Different arrangements could mean a different status.' (A Lambert & P Summerfield òUK Supreme Court delivers verdict in Uber case' (2021) 10(2) Comp & Risk 8 10) By reference to case law statutory provisions and academic writing discuss whether this statement is an accurate assessment of how the employment status of employees and workers are determined by UK courts. \u2003 Criteria for Assessment  How you will be marked This assessment will be marked in accordance with the University's Undergraduate mark descriptors.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/09/mgt601-dynamic-leadership/,Assessment Task The task for this assessment is to prepare and present a plan for your development as a leader. The period of your plan could be 2 5 or 10 years. Select the period that makes most sense to you depending on the current stage of your life and career. Briefly explain the reason for the time period that you have selected. Your plan needs to be based on or anchored by an established model of personal development. A number of possible models were provided in Module 1. The choice of SubjectCode_Assessment_#_Brief_AssesmentType_Module Due# Page 2 of 6 model is up to you. The Whitmore GROW and Boyatzis Intentional Change models are two of the most comprehensive at a personal level. However other models may be more relevant to your current needs. You are also welcome to use an appropriate model that was not included in Module 1 provided it meets the tests of academic rigour and usefulness to you. You must provide a brief description of your chosen model and a justification for your selection. It is important that you go to the source documents and not rely only on the summary version of your chosen model. Please also include a section in your report about the impact of national culture on your leadership direction. Your development plan must draw on the resources of the subject to demonstrate your increased awareness of the factors that contribute to effective leadership. Your development goals should be based on at least four of the topics covered in the subject such as enhanced emotional intelligence more effective strategic thinking enhanced influencing and motivational skills greater cultural sensitivity greater support for creativity and innovation more effective change leadership greater resilience etc Additional information on leadership development to help you prepare your plan is provided in the Subject Resources section of each module. Structure: Within the body of your report the model of development that you choose will largely determine the structure and section headings. The precise structure is up to you however a clear logic flow is important. A possible structure for your report is as follows: 1. The use of an Executive Summaryù to summarise the content of your report. 2. A clear logic flow demonstrated by using a Table of Contentsù page and section headings. The Table of Contents should be attractively formatted to present a positive first impression to readers. 3. An Introductionù to set the context and provide background to the aim. 4. An Aimù that communicates exactly what the report is setting out to achieve. This should reflect and summarise the precise question set in the assessment brief. 5. The body of your report should address and explore the issues set out in the assessment brief. 6. A Conclusionù to capture your key learnings is desirable in a business subject. Detailed supporting information such as psychometric results and planning templates should be placed in an appendix where they will not be included in the word count. SubjectCode_Assessment_#_Brief_AssesmentType_Module Due# Page 3 of 6 7. A list of References formatted in the correct APA style. These sources need to have actually been consulted in the drafting of the assignment and must contain the information attributed to them. 8. Appendices may be used to hold information that is relevant to your discussion but not suitable (too lengthy complex etc) for inclusion in the body of your report. All items included in appendices must be referred to specifically in the report. Please note that Executive Summary Table of Contents References and Appendices are not included in the wordcount calculation. This structure is a suggestion only and is not mandatory however using this structure correctly will enable you to build a logical and comprehensive narrative. Other structures would be appropriate provided that they enable you to demonstrate your learning according to the rubric shown at the end of this brief. Detailed supporting information about your own personal leadership traits such as psychometric results mentoring with and by other students personal reflection planning templates etc. should be provided. These must be authentic  do not invent these elements. Think deeply and write authentically from the heart. Include specific detail and demonstrate understanding of the subject content. Note that deep personal reflection lies at the heart of this report and there needs to be recognition of personal change as a result of this reflection. SMART methodology will ensure the details of your plan are both measurable and achievable. These goals must be grounded in your core values and reflect alignment with your authentic leadership behaviors. Your discussion MUST reflect the topics presented in this course as a minimum. It is expected that students will demonstrate that they understand and can apply the various theoretical perspectives contained in the modules    Read less,MGT601 Dynamic Leadership
https://scribing.shop/2021/11/10/hlsc609-facilitiating-learning-in-health-professional-settings/,Purpose: As an educator you are expected to be clear about what you want your learners to learn and what your learners have to do in order to demonstrate that they have learned at the appropriate level (in other words have a clear òroadmap'). You are also expected to have knowledge about how to provide guidance to the learner and how you can best enact guiding the learner to learn effectively at the desired cognitive level. This assignment gives you the opportunity to link education theory with practice by designing an effective learning activity (1 hour duration) for your own area of practice. To assist you with this you will use a lesson plan template. A lesson plan is a document that is used by the educator to not only guide (the roadmap!) the development of the learning activity but also assists in considering all aspects/variables and what will be needed to ensure a successful session. For example this includes learner considerations (who are they what prior knowledge do they have) timing where and physical environment. Details included in a lesson plan vary depending on the activity however usually include subject being covered goals objectives (what the student will learn) teaching strategies/activities (the method/procedure to assist the student to meet the L/O) content headings to be covered (and how long is required for each section) what material / resources will be needed and how you plan to measure if the L/O have been achieved and the feedback loop of evaluation of the session/program. As this assessment includes a portfolio (with two items)  the lesson plan (you can download from the HLSC609 LEO site and adapt to suit your needs) will be one of these resources. The other can be any resource that you choose to develop for the program such as digital learning resources or the evaluation tool you develop. Learning outcomes assessed: 3 Assignment 2: E portfolio: Assignment 2 e portfolio consist of 2 sections: Part 1  E porfolio a) Design a one-hour lesson plan/learning activity that requires students to achieve a set of learning outcomes one of which must be a demonstration of decision making/clinical reasoning skills (you can use the template provided or develop your own); b) One further resource of your selection  This could be one part of the lesson such as a PowerPoint presentation a resource used for a learning activity or a detailed outline of an assessment piece. Part 2  Written critique Prepare a 2500 word critique related to the constructively aligned lesson plan and learning activities (and resources) which must include strategies to encourage critical thinking and reflective practice HLSC609  Assessment 2 Tips that may address FAQ in your learners. Your discussion paper should clearly articulate the rationale for the learning activity; explain how the lesson plan/learning activity will lead to the achievement of student learning outcomes; present a rationale for assessment strategies and articulate your plans for improvement and refinement of the activity. Consideration of diverse student participants the role of the facilitator and organisational constraints and enablers should also be included. Your critique should be supported by the use of contemporary and relevant literature. How to submit: Assignment 2 is to be submitted via the Assignment 2 Turnitin dropbox located within the HLSC609 LEO site. There will be 2 dropbox clearly identified as Assignment 2 & E Portfolio. Multiple submissions can be made up until the due date for the assessment (please note that there can be a 24-48 hour lock out period between each submission). Return of assignment: Your mark and feedback for Assignment 2 will be returned electronically via LEO òGrades' after final results are released for the unit. Assessment criteria: This assignment will be assessed using the Assessment 2 Marking Rubric located in the Appendices section of the unit outline. Top ten tips for developing your e portfolio and written critique: 1) Engage with and finish all the activities in the modules as this will give you a clear starting point. Read weekly messages the ask the lecturer forum and discussion forums as these may also provide òthinking points' and further information / direction. 2) Research and read widely become the expert on your selected topic and tea    Read less,HLSC609 Facilitiating Learning in Health Professional Settings
https://scribing.shop/2021/11/10/capabilities-to-analyse-the-features/,This aim of this assessment is to determine the student's capabilities to analyse the features cloud offers compare traditional IT services with Cloud Services and how different service models can be utilised to solve a challenge using different public cloud providers. During this assessment students will go through four case studies one each week and prepare a report of 2400 words (total). Instructions: Your facilitator will provide you with four scenarios. Please be advised that the following points were taken into consideration during the scenario selection process: \uf0b7 Each of the four scenarios presented are from different service and deployment models. \uf0b7 They cater for different service sectors of cloud like web application big data IoT and/or Artificial Intelligence. \uf0b7 Each uses a variety of services from providers. \uf0b7 The scenarios are taken from popular public cloud providers.  The assessment requires you to prepare a report based on the case studies provided by your faciliatator.  Report Instructions: Start off with a short introduction (approximately 250 words) stating basic information relevant to the report and introducing relevant points relating to the case studies. For example you can provide background information including some context related to cloud computing. This section will be written in complete sentences and paragraphs. No tables graphs diagrams or dot points should be included. The structure main body of the report should comprise of four different sections 600 words each (one section for each case study) based on the above mentioned case studies. With each section specifically addressing the following about the case study. \uf0b7 Analysis of the case \uf0b7 Analysing the service model for the case study including the services by the provider and each scenario utilised. \uf0b7 Compare and contrast different deployment models for this scenario. \uf0b7 Analyse the application of different services each case study used. \uf0b7 Reflection Finally write a conclusion (approximately 250 words) as a summary of your analysis of the case. This section brings together all of the information that you have presented in your report and should link to the purpose of the assessment as mentioned in the introduction. You can also discuss any areas which have been identified as requiring further investigation and how this will work to improve or change our understanding of the topic. This section does not introduce or discuss any new information specifically and like the introduction will be written in complete sentences and paragraphs.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/10/des222-responsive-website-design-and-physical-model/,Create a design fiction artefact with an accompanying essay that contextualises the artefact and provides a perspective on the future of interaction design. The design fiction artefact should explore potential futures for user experience and interaction design. The design fiction will include a physical model even if driven primarily by web- or appbased technologies. The physical model should be presented in as realistic context/situation as possible. This likely means that the project will be documented as a series of photographs or potentially video. Further elaboration will be provided in class discussion. Accompany the design fiction with a 500-word contextualisation and future perspective essay. Elaborations on the basic brief Note that most of the following notes are directly linked to the assessment criteria so use those criteria and these notes to guide your development. Artefact: A physical (preferred) or digital object you make. It is likely that many projects will have components of both. It is unlikely to be a working interactive project but should be well resolved with the form and appearance of something real. If physical this could be a model mock-up or other physical form. If digital this could be a mocked-up app website or other digital creation executed as a partial build or a digital prototype. Design fiction: This will be discussed extensively in class with plenty of supporting learning materials including videos. However the basic idea is that the fiction is not a text narrative but a fictional artefact through which we understand potential futures. The artefact will represent this future by standing in for that future. A question to ask yourself and that the artefact should ask of you is w at is the world like in this future that this artefact exists?ù Contextualisation: One of the purposes of a design fiction is to imagine the world in which your artefact exists. To contextualise the artefact means to demonstrate how the artefact fits into that imagined world. See the discussion of the criteria below for more on this topic. Potential futures: By potential future we are not necessarily trying to determine the most likely future. Rather we use the design fiction to better explore possible plausible futures. We are not necessarily trying to imagine the most advanced technologies or the most distant futures. Instead remember the ideas of the future accreting and the mundane future discussed in class to position your design fiction in a potential future. Physical model: The model does not need to actually function. After all we are designing for a future scenario in which the technology probably does not exist right now. However the model should appear to be a real object. This does not necessarily mean an incredibly elaborate fabrication task but it does require attention to detail. You might repurpose/relabel/re-use existing objects or tech components as the foundation or other aspects of the model. Realistic context/situation: Obviously we are not in the future so you will not have the artefact in a real situation. However you can present it in a realistic situation. This means putting the artefact in a surrounding physical or personal context that implies how it would fit into a future scenario. For example in the product-based convenience store design futures you've seen in class the artefacts are placed in a real convenience store to show context. Your situation/context could be quite different due to that fact that your project explores interaction and experience design. Documentation: You will make a physical object and should be bringing physical drafts to class but the final submission will include photographic or video documentation of the artefact in as realistic situation as possible. This is likely a staged photo or video. Back to the convenience store example: In that case you would likely place your object on a shelf in a real store long enough to photograph it in context. Video is only useful if it demonstrates the interaction effectively. If you do have video you should also have still photographs as they are much more versatile for presentation in print or on the web if needed. You do not need to submit your documentation and working notes made during the development process. However you should be keeping that along the way as part of good design practice and if you present this work in your portfolio in the future that will be an invaluable source if you present it as a case study. Those working notes should include sketches photographs and written material. In this project we are exploring thinking by making. This means that the development of ideas happens primarily through the physical artefact. You will create extremely rough prototypes at the beginning designed to get a tangible sense of the potential interaction with the object and its underlying technology developing a sense of the connection between form and experience as an ideation technique. The physical draft artefacts are particularly useful for sharing in class to get feedback from colleagues and instructors. Beyond the general principles of thinking by making and specific to this assessment the physical artefact acts a layer between the maker's imagining of possible future scenarios and the viewer/user's interpretation of the future via the artefact. Remember that the point of the artefact is as a tool to explore ideas of the future not just to create an object that you will explicitly design and take to production. So creating an object allows others to explore ideas of the future from a range of perspectives. That new knowledge generated can feed back into future design plans aimed at a specific likely future. Notice that this process explicitly and inherently requires feedback from others. That is why iteration is particularly important and signals that we shouldn't spend a lot of time on the early prototypes. Iterate rapidly and often to collect the feedback you can. Early iterations should probably be constructed from easy-to-find materials around the home. You can build onto existing objects modify existing objects or use other materials in any way that is useful. The goal is to get to a physical object that others can start to use to explore ideas of the future that that artefact might imply. Once again coming up with initial ideas can be difficult. One approach is to reconceive of an existing interaction/object with the addition of future technology embedded in different social environmental political regulatory or other circumstances. You can also start with a future world context and think about what objects would exist in those circumstances. A word of warning: don't get too attached to early concepts as they will evolve through the feedback process. Generating lots of ideas and rough physical forms early will be a useful resource as your project evolves. The design fiction you create should be intended to explore the nature of interaction and user experience in a future. This means that interactive potential built into the artefact via technology is likely to be part of the project. (i.e. you do something with the object and its response is mediated by technology rather than just a static or non-reactive physical form even if you can use it to perform an interaction.) Something about the artefact should imply that the form of interaction or experience you are exploring is fundamentally different from today. That is likely to partly come from technological advances but is almost certainly also due to a different context in which the artefact exists. Designing an object that is essentially just an implementation of the leading edge of a technology that exists now is less likely to be useful to explore futures on the timescale of a decade or two from now. Thinking about the interplay between object experience and future context is useful for pushing to interesting new possibilities. The essay should not be a fictional story or text about the artefact or its context. Most of that work should be done by the artefact itself. Instead the essay should be an exploration of how the design fiction helps us interrogate a potential future. The following questions might be useful to address although you do not need to address them all one by one. What does the design fiction do to evoke the future? How do your design choices contribute to creating a convincing scenario? Based on your discussions and feedback in class what characteristics of the future seem to be implied by the artefact (they might be social economic aesthetic political interactional technological ethical human posthuman scientific or other)? What particular aspect of interaction and user experience design is new or different in the future as explored by the artefact? The essay should refer to other relevant sources such as precursor projects related work theoretical ideas or any other work that informs your design process. The essay should be professional and clear but does not need to be overly academicù in style. Consider a style that would be appropriate for somebody looking at your portfolio.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/10/man1100-management-pizza-and-pub/,Your first work experience came in the eighth grade when your father opened the family pizza business. After university graduation you entered the construction business building homes for more than a decade. But then something drew you to make a change. So you took the family recipes and started your own restaurant Pizza & Pub which was deliberately located far enough away to avoid competing with your father. Your goal was simple: to build a fun family restaurant. Pizza & Pub  there are now two  have 8-metre-high floor-to-ceiling stone fireplaces stuffed bears moose òantler chandeliers' huge aquariums separating the bar and the restaurant and wood everywhere: oak floors and huge beams recycled from century-old barns. And they're huge each seating 320 guests. On a Friday night 1500 customers will eat at Pizza and Pub most waiting an hour for their tables while having a drink and eating free peanuts at the bar. Those 1500 customers will eat 3200 pizzas and takeaway customers order another 800. Why do they come? Beyond the great pizza they come for the value. A medium cheese pizza is $16; soft drinks are $2.80 with free refills; and the popular Italian beef sandwich is under $12. Pizza & Pub is really affordable especially for a sit-down restaurant. With things going so well you planned to open three more restaurants in the next five years. Unfortunately the recession changed your plans. Guest counts dropped by 20 per cent or 100000 people per year decreasing revenue by nearly $1 million. On top of that your managers were having difficulty controlling costs. Each week they conducted a physical count comparing food inventories (tomato sauce flour cheese beef liquor etc.) to the previous week and then adjusted for this week's sales. But beverage and food costs were still above goal: 22 per cent of revenues for beverages and 20 per cent of revenues for food. The problem as you discovered was your management staff all were hired externally because of their extensive experience at established well-known restaurant chains. You discovered that their idea of leadership learned in the òcommand and control' cultures of other restaurants was telling people what to do. So they had someone else put in the inventory numbers but this task was part of the person's job role. When the numbers came out wrong the management staff didn't dig deeper or ask questions to discover why. This led you as the business owner to question 3 your management and staff motivation. In the end with costs up revenues down and lending standards tightening the bank didn't approve the new construction loans for the three additional restaurants. So rather than expanding your immediate challenge is to fix and grow the two Pizza & Pub restaurants that you have. Frustrated with your management staff you gave responsibility for reducing costs to a 24-year-old who had worked for you since she was 16 and you knew was highly motivated to work for you and in this industry. She fixed the problem in four weeks by discussing the problem with the kitchen wait and bar staff who suggested immediate solutions to reduce costs. Once you had these solutions in place you pulled together the management and other staff from both restaurants. You outlined the current position of Pizza & Pub which showed that financial restrictions would need to be in place for at least the next 12 months. After answering questions from the management and staff you then asked for their help to improve the motivation and performance within the business. You also highlight that while you recognise everyone wants to be paid more you remind them that you are already paying award wages and increasing wages will not be an option for at least the next 12 months due to current financial constraints. 1.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/11/chc50113-early-childhood-education-and-care-services/,The educators and management at Bethany Kindergarten Services (BKS) acknowledge the importance of active play and physical activity behaviours that contribute to good health and overall wellbeing. This policy confirms our commitment to: Encourage children to engage in a range of child-initiated and adult-guided physical activities within the educational program. Promote the importance of a healthy lifestyle which includes being physically active every day. Provide opportunities for challenging and stimulating active play every day. As a health promoting service we will promote active play and physical activity for childreneducators and families through learning policies creating a safe and healthy physical and social environment and developing community links and partnerships. It is recognised that every member of the service impacts on the children's health and can contribute to creating an environment that promotes active play and physical activity. All members of our service including educators children families and volunteers will be supported to meet this policy. Encouraging physical activity by providing a range of active play experiences for all children at the BKS service Active play (play that involves using the large muscles in the body) develops a strong and healthy body builds motor and co-ordination skills creates a sense of wellbeing and helps protect from disease. It provides children with a range of physical emotional and social benefits. Active play is about moving being and doing. A strong sense of health and wellbeing supported by good nutrition and an active lifestyle can provide children with confidence energy and optimism that will contribute to their ability to concentrate co-operate and learn (Belonging Being & Becoming. Framework for Australia p30). Learning about healthy lifestyles including nutrition and active play links directly to Outcome 3 in both the Early Years Learning Framework and the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework. Active play: Large muscle-based activities that are essential for a child's social emotional cognitive and physical growth and development. It covers a range of activities including climbing throwing jumping and running lifting pushing and pulling appropriately-sized objects sweeping raking digging and being active to music movement and games. Child-initiated active play: is developed by the child through exploration of the environment equipment and games.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/11/indg-1001h-web-homelands-and-treaty-history-of-indigenous/,The lands we live on and the communities where we live are the homelands to the many and diverse Indigenous groups who continue to live in Canada. Many of the places we live emerged from natural gathering places for Indigenous people; many of the routes we follow today emerged from the routes utilized by Indigenous people. Many of our communities have place names that were first given by the Indigenous inhabitants of a particular area. In order to improve our understanding of where we live today this assignment asks you to research the history of your community in order to illuminate the Indigenous presenceîboth historical and contemporaryîof your community. If we are to achieve reconciliation connecting Indigenous understandings of the world to our own lived understanding of community is essential In this assignment we ask you to research the history and contemporary presence of Indigenous peoples for your home community. A local understanding of Indigenous Peoples in your community is essential for you to understand your role and responsibility in reconciliation. We ask you to create a research report that examines the Indigenous history and the contemporary presence of Indigenous Peoples in your community.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/11/ssc310-health-and-social-care-reasonable-duties/,The purpose of the placement is to help the student improve their own learning and performance whilst relating subject specific knowledge within the òwork' environment. Specifically the learning outcomes for the module are as follows: Knowledge: Demonstrate clear knowledge of the relevance which subject specific study has within a particular area of work environment An awareness of analysis organising material and writing skills The ability to carry out a small-scale organisational evaluation and or research Identified and evaluated those transferable skills you would like to develop The òpractice' may be undertaken in a private statutory or voluntary agency where you are already employed/working as a volunteer or in a different organisation. The period of òcontact' within your chosen setting may also be negotiated with your pathway tutor provided that the assessment criteria can be met. Whatever the setting this module will enable the student to: Extend and evaluate your understanding of their chosen programme pathway Broaden their awareness of organisational processes and policies Enhance analytic and written communication skills Identify those transferable skills which they would like to develop Evaluate their competence in these skills Who is responsible for organizing the Placement? The student is responsible for identifying and contacting a potential placement opportunity. However both the Placement Tutor and the Academic Team may be able to help with suggestions and possible initial contacts where possible. Once the student has identified a potential placement and before they start they need to complete all appropriate documentation  see below. The student will not officially be considered as being on placement until this documentation has been completed and returned to the Placement Tutor for approval.  Length and Timing of the Placement The placement lasts for 60 hours with the timing and structure being negotiated between the student and placement provider. It will take place in Term 2. Planning and Preparation for the Placement The placement should be negotiated by the student and approved by the module leader. For the purposes of the module the placement activity will be undertaken for or through an agency or organisation whose aim it is to support people within a health and social care context. The placement will normally be around London and the South East of England or in a place convenient to you Each student should consider their personal skills and interests when choosing a placement which could be in a wide variety of agencies. Any activity may be considered if it enables them to meet the learning objectives and other requirements of the module. Whilst the Tutor may offer support it is the responsibility of the student to make any contact with an organization. The placement should be negotiated with a Practice Supervisor and should provide the opportunity to observe and become involved in normal organisational activities relevant to the student's interests knowledge skills and abilities. The exact nature of the placement will vary and be unique to each student. It is important to identify a practice supervisor who agrees to provide on-going support and guidance in the placement. The placement should be for a total of 60 hours the duties and times being negotiated between the student and the practice supervisor when agreeing the Learning Contract (see below). The placement may commence with an on-site induction and students may if appropriate be required to undergo training. These requirements will be included in the Learning Contract and will be included in your required 60 hours of placement. Preparing a CV: Some organisations will ask for a CV. The student is therefore encouraged to either initiate or update their CV prior to approaching an organization. Advice and guidance on this is available from the University Careers and Employability Service. Completion of Appropriate Documentation Prior to Placement Once the student has identified a potential placement opportunity the following documents must be completed 1.Initial Interest Form 2.Placement Proposal Form 3.Learning Contract 4.Risk Assessment Form Once these are returned and the placement approved the student can commence the placement. Copies of these forms and guidance notes on their completion are included as appendices in this Handbook. If further help is required prior to their completion please contact the Placement Tutor. Completion of other documentation during and at the end of placement It is expected that the student keep a record of the hours completed on placement using the Record of Hours form (copy in appendices). On completion of the placement confirmation of the 60 hours achieved together with a brief supervisors report confirming that the student has successfully completed the placement learning outcomes should be completed and signed by the supervisor. N.B. The placement and hence the module cannot be passed without this document. It is expected that the student is allocated a named supervisor for the duration of their placement. Due to the varied and broad occupational contexts in which the student may be working within it is not possible to stipulate any specific level of qualification which the supervisor may have. However it is hoped they have a level of experience appropriate to their role. Similarly it is unrealistic to stipulate the number and duration of supervisory sessions that take place over the course of the placement. However it is hoped that time is scheduled to allow the student to discuss and review their progress in achieving the learning outcomes. Should any supervisor have any queries about this then please contact the Placement Tutor. See also section on roles and responsibilities on page 11. Teaching input to support the placement There are a number of taught sessions that support the placement which include identification of learning needs evaluation reflective and professional practice and how to make the most of the placement. These are planned formal teaching sessions which take place at the start of the module. Later more informal sessions are delivered to respond to individual needs of the student and which reflect the student placement experience. All teaching materials are available on Canvas and relevant texts are available on My Module Resources. However the primary source of learning for the student is via experiential learning meaning that the student learns by actively participating in the placement. On-going review Your personal review of the experience will be a continuous process recorded in your reflective placement journal/diary and is part of your assessment and portfolio. You must establish contact with the module leader immediately if you experience any problems or difficulties or if there are any changes proposed to the agreed terms of reference in the Learning Contract. Telephone contact between the module leader and the practice supervisor will be made within the first half of your placement in time to discuss your progress to date. This will include consideration of your personal attributes for example: punctuality time keeping adaptability attitude to work etc. How is the Student Assessed? The student must present at the end of the placement a portfolio of evidence. This includes the following: The learning contract drawn up between student and placement provider A project divided into THREE sections. A Portfolio Reflective journal report and a Written Placement report/Evaluation or a (Reflection and Evaluation of organisation) Research project (Approx. 4000 words) Additional information on the organization including for example any materials produced work placement records case study notes bibliography of material consulted etc. n.b. the student must include the portfolio documents to achieve a pass in each of the above elements. These assessments will measure how the student has RECORDED and EVALUATED their placement and to what extent they have achieved the essential learning outcomes and those any additional ones identified in the Learning Contract. This takes into account the varied nature of placements so that the quality of placement does not become a predictor of the quality of the assessed work. Students are NOT assessed on placement performance however the practice supervisor will be asked to complete an evaluation to assess whether or not they have achieved the tasks agreed in the Learning Contract and if not the reasons why not.

AMT is a multi-national publicly listed medical software and technology developer serving clients in hospitals specialist medical services and medical research. AMT is headquartered in Melbourne Australia and has 15000 employees across its operations in Australia China France and Germany. Recently AMT lost three major clients to competitors and their market share has declined substantially in the last two years. Paul Clarke was recently promoted to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) from his role as Chief Operations Officer (COO). He is determined to transform the company to become a dominant player in the global market. He has made a commitment to the Board to do this in the next two years. In planning for the future the executive team have agreed that there must be greater workforce flexibility and an increase in the ability of managers to lead teams and manage performance. The CEO believes there are problems with the organisation's culture and sees significant differences between sites across the globe. He is determined to break down the organisational silos which have stifled communication and collaboration. In a meeting with the Chief Human Resources Officer Denise Hagan you have been advised that staff turnover has steadily increased over the last three years and now sits at 20%. Those leaving often sight a lack of development and support from their manager as a source of frustration. Additionally staff are critical of the way changes in the organisation have been communicated and managed. The COVID 19 pandemic has forced many to work-from-home which has strained team and management relationships and highlighted AMT's inability to adapt quickly to changes in the external environment. AMT is lacking some depth of knowledge and competence. This was highlighted recently when the Chief Research and Development Officer Dr. Fei Chen was headhunted by a competitor. She is an industry recognised leader in the development of artificial intelligence in health diagnostics. HR have been trying to fill her role for three months without success. The CEO's goal is being a dominant player in the global market. To achieve this three objectives have been set to achieve in the next two years: 1.Develop management capabilities in facilitating rapid change Your task is to produce a report with recommendations on how this objective could be achieved. Of course the task involves using relevant concepts/models you have studied in this subject. You will need to apply the relevant concepts/models to figure out how each of the objectives can be achieved and to come up with recommendations. To assist you in getting started your group should consider the following questions (please note that these questions are not meant to be the sections of your report): What is your methodology / approach to tackle this task and how to conduct your analysis of the AMT's managing people and teams' situation? What real world case studies can be used to support your analysis and recommendations? What assumptions and / or limitations have you made or applied which will impact your analysis or recommendations? Together with your recommendations to each of the three objectives consider how the change can be implemented    Read less,ZAC108 Leading and Managing People and Medical Technologies

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/12/nur103-practical-nursing-traumatic-events/,Emergency Nurses are routinely confronted with work related traumatic events and hectic work conditions. Several studies report a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in these nurses. Coping and social support seem to play an important role in the development of PTSD. Objectives: This study examines (1) the frequency of exposure to and the nature of traumatic events in Emergency Nurses (2) the percentage of nurses that report symptoms of PTSD anxiety depression somatic complaints and fatigue at a sub-clinical level and (3) the contribution of traumatic events coping and social support to PTSD symptoms psychological distress somatic complaints fatigue and sleep disturbances. Design: Cross-sectional data from 248 Emergency Nurses from 15 Flemish (Belgian) general hospitals were analyzed Emergency Nurses were found to be confronted frequently with work related traumatic events. Death or serious injury of a child/adolescent was perceived as the most traumatizing event.Almost one out of three nurses met sub-clinical levels of anxiety depression and somatic complaints and 8.5% met clinical levels of PTSD. Levels of fatigue were high but not directly related to the frequency of exposure to traumatic events. Emotional coping was related to an increase in all outcomes; avoidant coping was related to more somatic complaints; problem focused coping was related to a decrease in psychological distress and perceived fatigue. Social support from colleagues and supervisor (head nurse) was found to have a protective effect on the occurrence of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: Emergency Nurses are especially vulnerable to post-traumatic stress reactions due to repetitive exposure to work related traumatic incidents. This not only personally affects the nurses but can also impact quality of care. Hospital management should act on the findings of this study and invest in supportive communicative empathic and anticipatory leadership and provide time-out facilities cognitive-behavioral interventions and psychological counseling for Emergency Nurses on  Emergency unit is a stressful fast-paced and demanding environment 16 . The ED nurses are routinely caring of traumatized patients and life threatening. Such daily scenarios place nurses at an increased risk for occurrence of STS symptoms 2 . Psychological responses to traumatic events often seen as normal and usually diminishes within short period of time. However repetitive exposure to traumatic events may hinder the normal recovery process and may result in the development of psychological disorders 20 . Consequently the ED nurses are at risk and tend to develop STS more than others due to nature being repetitively exposed to traumatized individuals 21 . Another factor may contribute to STS among the ED nurses is being involved in a high level empathetic relationship with the traumatized individuals 22 . Sharing empathy is a central concept and key component. in the process of developing STS among nurses 21 . Although empathy is a core therapeutic technique in nursing care however empathy may transfer trauma feelings from victims to nurses. Consequently nurses either have positive feelings about their ability to help others which is known as compassion satisfaction or have negative feelings that may precipitate for STS 3 . Furthermore imminence nature and increased frequency of traumatic events confronted by nurses in ED departments have also contributed to development of STS among ED nurses. The repetitive exposure to such events is assumed to be associated with serious ychological and physical consequences on nurses in ED departments and can contribute to high risk of STS among them 15.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/12/pubh6003-health-systems-and-economics-health-system-goals/,Health care financing system as defined by Uzochukwu et al. (2015) is a process by which revenues are collected from primary and secondary sources e.g. outëofëpocket payments (OOPs) indirect and direct taxes donor funding coëpayment voluntary prepayments mandatory prepayment which are accumulated in fund pools so as to share risk across large population groups and using the revenues to purchase goods and services from public and private providers for identified needs of the population e.g. fee for service capitation budgeting and salaries. An effective healthcare financing system is established through good financing strategies which mobilize resources for healthcare achieve equity and efficiency in use of healthcare spending and ensure quality and affordable healthcare as well as adequate provision of essential healthcare goods and services (Uzochukwu et al. 2015 p. 438). For the sake of delivering its goals a proper healthcare system financing ensures adequate financial protection in order to prevent individuals/households from being impoverished because they accessed health services and one way of ensuring a continual financial protection is through inducting a risk sharing plan in the system thereby making the risk of incurring unexpected health expenditure not to fall on one person (Uzochukwu et al. 2015 p. 438). Ensuring adequate access to one's health needs without making without making significant Out of Pocket payment (OOP) at service point is one aim of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) which can be achieved through risk pooling either through tax funded or social health insurance (SHI) (Uzochukwu et al. 2015 p. 439) How a country finances its healthcare system plays a thematic role in attaining UHC because it determines whether health services exist and available as well as their affordability to people as the need arises. This is achievable through a well-planned combination of all healthcare financing mechanisms including; Taxation OOPs donor funding health insurance exemptions deferrals and subsidies (Uzochukwu et al. 2015 p. 439) Donor funding involves financial aid rendered to developing countries (which could be in form of loans or grants) to boost socio-economic or health developments (Uzochukwu et al. 2015 p. 442). Official Development Assistance (ODA) from developed nations in the region of 0.7% target of their gross national product. Just like many other developing countries. Firstly low-income developing countries not meeting universal health coverage goals for essential health services as a result of inability to raise fund exclusively from domestic sources within a foreseeable future is usually what gives rise to international assistance and it may seem as though most countries in this category have pressing health needs (Cavagnero E et al. 2008 p. 864)hence increased international aid is needed to balance increased domestic fund however there is usually a downside to a rapid arrival of foreign aid which could give rise to Dutch-disease (an adverse macroeconomic impact of foreign exchange on a country's economy) (Cavagnero E et al. 2008 p. 864). According to Cavagnero et al. (2008) there are some general effects of increased donor funding as well as health aid risk factors for example; Domestic demand and prices: saving a windfall received through donor funding will have no adverse/direct economic impact but that is not what the aid is meant for. Spending of donor fund especially on non-traded goods and services is likely to lead to inflation. International competitiveness: According to experts spending a large boon of foreign exchange is capable of making a country less competitive either by raising inflation or by making the foreign currency appreciate over the country's local currency i.e a depreciation of domestic prices in relation to foreign prices in the real exchange rate (RER). Donor aid to Africa has been associated with depreciation of RER. Growth: While increased inflow of foreign aid may boost demand for non-tradable goods it can also raise domestic prices and lower profits of export goods. Cavagnero et al. (2008) highlights reviews of cross-country studies that show evidences of general symptoms of aid-induced Dutch disease that are not related to health spending for example increased donor fund was associated with RER appreciation and weak performance of manufacturing sector was reported in Malawi Pakistan and Sri lanka. For specifics Nigeria healthcare financing through donor funding does not promote health goals because donor funding in Nigeria has been on a decline way before the switch to 1999 democratic governance as records show yearly official development assistance income from 1999 to 2007 was estimate at US$2.335 and US$4.674per capita respectively (Olakunde 2012). These figure are still below the average of US$28 per capita mapped out for sub-Saharan Africa. Even though records show that donor funding is increasing it still accounts for a small proportion of public health spending(Olakunde 2012).the data from Global Health Expenditure Database still corroborates this as foreign aid contributes 7.8% of the sources of health expenditure; a figure that been on a steady decline since 2013 (Global Health Expenditure Database n.d.). Nigeria operates a dual healthcare delivery system (orthodox and traditional) and involves public private and voluntary stakeholders with health service provision being the function of the three tiers of government- federal state and local governments (Oyibocha et al. 2014 p. 30). The Nigerian public sector operates a decentralized health system which is run the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) state ministry of health (SMoH) and Local government Health Department (LGHD). Albeit the responsibility of running PHC lies with the local government all three tiers of government alongside various agencies all participate in the management of PHC which sometimes result in duplication overlapping and confusion of roles (Olakunde 2012). In Nigeria the key challenges with donor funding remain coordination of funds and tracking donor resource flow as a result of the vast number of federal health agencies stakeholders and other parastatals; the interrelatedness in the nature of their planning coordination and systems (most of which are redundant) creates difficulty in linking responsibilities in areas of authority policies plans programs etc (Swaziland & World Health Organization 2015).

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/15/edu501-learning-theoriescognitive-learning/,Introduction Cognitive learning is a change in knowledge attributable to experience (1). It differs from behavioral learning in that cognitive learning involves a change in the learner's knowledge whereas behavioral learning involves a change in the learner's behavior. Cognitive learning theories help us to understand how children learn. Cognitive learning theories explain how factors internal and external influence individual mental processes that supplement learning. Several theorists have written theories that focus on this topic. As educators it is important to understand the various attributes of the theories and how they may illuminate the ways in which students learn. Preparation For this assignment you will research the following cognitive learning theorists and their theories. Jean Piaget and cognitive learning theory. Lev Vygotsky and sociocultural theory. Information processing theory (Note: This theory has no specific theorists attached to it). In addition you will research these types of cognitive learning: Classical conditioning. Operant conditioning. Observational conditioning. Identify three sources to support your writing. Once you have completed the research follow the instructions below to complete the assignment. Instructions Write a 35 page paper in which you: Discuss Piaget and Vygotsky's theories as well as information processing theory. Include the key points of the theories. Explain how each impacts student learning. Discuss the key points of the three types of cognitive learning. Identify the similarities between the three types of cognitive learning. Identify the differences between the three types of cognitive learning. Select one theory and one type of cognitive learning and explain how you could implement them as an educator. Use three sources to support your writing outside of your textbook. Choose sources that are credible relevant and appropriate.

A redesign of the packaging of Palmolive's Milk and Honey body wash is needed to aid the reimaging of the brand. The use of the brown bottle light shades of green and black print on the label will adhere to the emerging packaging trends in the industry. The repositioned product will appeal to the selected target market being more aesthetically pleasing and contemporary adding a sleekness and style. Palmolive products currently still contain harmful chemicals therefore to keep up with industry trends they will benefit from a product reposition to contain natural home grown ingredients. Consumers are becoming more health conscious therefore to hold their position within the market increase awareness among a new target market and increase sales it is vital for Palmolive to make the adjustments to their product to successfully keep up with market trends. Due to the extensive changes made to the packaging labelling and product ingredients it is probable that Palmolive with need to increase the price of their body wash by 11% from $1.08 per 100ml to $1.198 per 100ml to adhere to the sales objective of increasing sales by 6% over a twelve-month period. The distribution of Palmolive's newly repositioned Milk and Honey body wash will involve indirect distribution channels starting from Palmolive's manufacturing factories shipped to national distribution centres then directly to major supermarkets chemists and pharmacies service stations gyms and hotels across Australia.

The second phase of the implementation process will be the product development this phase will also include product testing and quality tests to ensure the product is of the specified standard. The third stage will be promotion where Palmolive will need to have the new product appeal to the existing customers along with the new selected target market. Finally Palmolive will need to evaluate the product after the launch along with the progress of reaching the company objectives. This stage will determine whether the current strategy is successful or if a new strategy will need to be put in place. Planning is a phase in the schedule where Palmolive will be able to identify their proposed target market identify ways in which new customers will be attracted to the repositioned product set goals and time frames for marketing objectives and map out a strategy on how to reach the target audience.

Other factors that will need to be considered in the planning phase is competitor pricing along with potential cost of production and marketing for the new product. Pricing research will be conducted in the first three months of the planning phase with the new price to be set in March. The design of the promotional material will be conduced during February and March ready to be implemented at the very beginning of the twelve-month promotional period. For the success of the reposition of Palmolive' Milk and Honey body wash it is crucial that the proposed research and planning is completed comprehensively.

This will ensure that the product is within the specifications for the final product with adequate manufacturing processes. Good quality control will help Palmolive to meet consumer demands and produce a better product. During the product development stage the sales department will notify all supplying major retailers pharmacies and service stations of Palmolive's Milk and Honey body wash brand reposition.

No one had lived in the farmhouse for many years and there was no electricity. After looking around the farm they became concerned that there was a problem with the electricity connection. Emily and David asked the agent about it. The agent said to them: You just have to connect the electricity when you move in.ù Emily and David still felt concerned and raised it with their conveyancer who sought an additional special condition in the contract which said: The vendors confirm that electricity is connected and available to the property.ù The vendor's conveyancer agreed to the inclusion of the above special condition. Emily and David proceeded to exchange contracts and six weeks later settled their purchase. After settlement Emily and David contacted the electricity provider to connect the electricity. They were informed that the line poles and transformer would all have to be upgraded before there would be any power to the farm. After speaking with a contractor they were advised this would cost $50000. Advise David and Emily of their legal position. Question Two: You are the conveyancer acting on behalf of Sandra who is selling her property. Sandra contracted with a real estate agent Matthew to sell her property. The Agency Agreement provides that Matthew had to use his best endeavours to sell the property for between $400000 to $450000 in three months. Provided that he did this then he was entitled to 3% commission on the sale price of the property. As soon as the property was on the market Sandra began to feel pressured by Matthew to sell the property whenever purchasers made offers. With each offer Matthew would become more impatient with her. He would call Sandra four or five times a day and tell her that she was lucky to get offers and would emphasise issues with the property that needed repair or updating. The property was eventually sold for $445000 after two months but Sandra was left feeling disappointed with the process and that the property could have been sold for a better price if Matthew had not acted the way he did in pressuring her. Before settlement of the sale of the property Sandra tells you that she doesn't want to pay Matthew the whole commission because he doesn't deserve it due to his behaviour. Advise Sandra. Question Three: Anne parked her car in a carpark outside a movie theatre. Although she saw a sign when she entered the carpark she only read the heading òConditions of Parking.' The rest of the sign was written in very small letters and Anne could not have read the rest of the sign unless she got out of the car. There was nothing printed on her ticket for entry to the carpark except for the time of entry. The Conditions of Parking contained a clause that said: òDrivers park at their own risk and assume all responsibility for securing their vehicle and valuables.' When Anne returned to her car she found that one of her car windows was smashed and her iPod and navigator were missing. Advise Anne about her prospects of making the carpark owners or operators responsible for the damage and loss of her personal property. Question Four: A purchaser brings you a contract for a property they want to buy. They tell you that they intend to knock the house down and build a luxury two-storey house. Based on the contract you advise that the property is 500 square metres in total area and is located about 75 metres from the ocean. Due to the proximity to the ocean there is no building permitted higher than a single-storey house. The purchaser is surprised and shows you an advertising brochure stating òBuild your dream home!' The purchaser wants to know whether the real estate agents can say this particularly when the purchaser certainly can't build their dream home.    Read less],PDVC102 Balance of Probabilities

This assignment is intended to enhance your awareness of self (both personally and professionally) in the context of values and nursing. This process of self-awareness will involve developing a personal philosophy of nursing and identifying how you will advance your learning your professional development as a practical nurse student. You will be asked to re-visit this philosophy later in your program of study. Once you have completed all of the requirements for your e-Portfolio development please submit the marking guide to the e-Portfolio Development Dropbox Consider this excerpt from Articulating Your Philosophy of Nursingù (Denehy 2001) One strategy nurses can use to affirm that their practice is in harmony with their value system is to write a personal philosophy statement. This might be general in nature such as a philosophy that relates to life values or it could be a philosophy statement related to beliefs about the profession of nursing‚ In each case this activity will encourage nurses to clarify their values and then examine how their philosophy fits with their professional practice. Articulating a philosophy statement is an intellectual activity that requires careful thought because values need to be identified clarified and prioritized.ù    Read less,PN155 Philosophy of Practical Nursing of Practice

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/15/poli2200-politics-and-ethics-ethical-issue/,This project is to be done in groups of four. Each team will take opposing viewpoints regarding an ethical issue that they will have to debate; two members who are `for` a particular issue and two members who is `against` it. Purpose and guidelines: Ethical issues will be debated throughout the semester. In order to develop critical thought about such matters you are to each submit one 1000-1500-word essay about an ethical issue of your choice- therefore each group is to submit 4 separate papers (one for each member each graded separately). In each group of 4 2 members should research their pro stanceù and the other 2 members should research their con stanceù. Individual research papers will be preparatory for the live in-class debate. In other words the main points of your paper will be reflecting in the arguments you will debate in class against the opposing team.  You must confirm your ethical issue with your instructor.  Groups will be presenting their debates in interactive PowerPoint presentations to the class.  Content checklist: 1)Introduce the ethical issue and the debate surrounding it. You will need to present he viewpoint on each side of the argument(s). Use factual information from your research. Make sure you are not merely stating an opinion your arguments must need to be backed up with proven facts not opinions or assumptions. This link can give you guidelines on credible sourcing: http://library.concordia.ca/help/guides.php?guid=finding 2)A conclusion: write about your experience doing the project- what did you learn? What was easy or difficult?  3)Back it up with at least 3 individual arguments to defend your position on the issue and 6 in total to be debated with your teammate against the other 2 members of your group. Make sure your arguments do not overlap. It will be important to work with your teammates on this as you need to make sure not to double up on positions. Why did this point of view `win you over`?  It is very important to have a good perspective of the debate and to identify what the key arguments are. It isn't enough to rebut a few random arguments here and there. Of course the techniques used above are invaluable but they must be used appropriately. There are a number of things you should do to systematically break down a team's case:  1.Ask yourself how the other side have approached the case. Is their methodology flawed?  2.Consider what tasks the other side set themselves (if any) and whether they have in fact addressed these.  3.Consider what the general emphasis of the case is and what assumptions it makes. Try to refute these.  Take the main arguments and do the same thing. It is not worth repeating a point of rebuttal that has been used by someone else already but you can refer to it to show that the argument has not stood up. It is not necessary to correct every example used. You won't have time and your aim is to show the other side's case to be flawed in the key areas.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/17/lcbb6000-business-management-ethics-and-privacy/,The Harvard system of referencing is the most commonly used and determines the manner in which students are to set out references and bibliographies. It is essential that students acknowledge all of the sources they have used as it: (a)proves that the work has a factual basis; (b)allows the reader to identify and retrieve the sources for their own use; and (c)shows the research the student has undertaken to reach the conclusions. Wherever you quote (that is copy directly from another author) or use their ideas (paraphrase) you must acknowledge that you have done so and you are required to use the Harvard System throughout your work. Failure to acknowledge your sources of information may result in your facing charges of plagiarism which may result in disciplinary action. Citations in text Citations in the text direct readers to the referenced list at the end of the text. The author's surname year of publication and page number(s) if appropriate should appear in the text. There are a number of different ways in which citations can be included: (a)If the author's name does not form part of the statement in the text then the name date and page number(s) should be put in brackets. Example There is evidence (Edworthy 1990 p. 23) that òthe main cause of stress in teaching is rapid change'. (b)If the author's name forms part of the statement put the date and page number(s) in brackets. Example Edworthy (1990 p. 23) cited evidence that òthe main cause of stress in teaching is rapid change'. (c)If there are two authors the surnames separated by òand' should be given before the date. Example Edworthy and Jones (1990 p. 64) proved that òthe main cause of stress in teaching is rapid change'. OR It has been proven (Edworthy and Jones 1990 p. 64) that òthe main cause of stress in teaching is rapid change'. (d)If there are between three and five authors the first time you cite them in the text you should give all surnames (in the order found on the title of the book) separating the names of the authors with commas and the last comma will be followed by òand'. Example Edworthy Evans and Smith (1990) have made various claims that we each cause our own stress.  Or It has been claimed (Edworthy Evans and Smith 1990) that we each cause our own stress. Subsequent references should be in abbreviated form that is the surname of the first author followed by òet al'. Example Edworthy et al (1990) have provided a range of evidence to show that we each cause our own stress. (e)Where there are six or more authors you should give only the first author's surname followed by òet al'. (f)When citing the work of one author found in the work of another you should acknowledge that you did not consult the original source. Example Supporting evidence appears in a study by Cox (1989 cited in Edworthy and Jones 1990 p. 64). òCited in' indicates that you are referring to Cox's study as found in a book by Edworthy and Jones. NB. (g)For works published in the same year and by the same author suffixes òa' òb' etc. are added to the year. Both the date and letter are used in citing the source. NB. Remember to use the date and the letter when including the reference in your bibliography. Example Edworthy (1990a p. 23) has provided evidence that òthe main cause of stress in teaching is rapid change'. It has been shown by Edworthy (1990b p. 47) that when asked to rate their work performance part-time and temporary workers were òmuch less likely than full-timers to rate themselves above average'. (h)To cite a website with a known author use only the name of the author followed by the year the page that the web page/online document was produced/updated. If this date is not shown the date of access should be used. If there is no author use the name of the organisation. Example Jones (2001) says abacavir may be taken more than twice a day. ..(Training Wales 2001)‚. (i)  When paraphrasing the views of a number of authors/sources in one sentence/paragraph the surnames and years of publication should be provided in brackets in alphabetical order separated by semi-colons. Example Evidence seems to suggest that stress is more prevalent amongst part-time workers than full-time workers (Cox 1989; Edworthy & Jones 1990; Weber 1988). What Punctuations to Use In the majority of cases you will need to use single inverted commas (ò ) for a quotation. For example you might make reference to Marx's point that òreligion is the opiate of the people'. Never italicise quotations (unless italics are found in the original quote or unless you are quoting stage directions in a play. Additional marks are needed when you are quoting dialogue or whenever you are quoting a sentence that includes a quote within it. On these occasions use single inverted commas for the quote as a whole and double inverted commas () for the inner quotation or dialogue. So for example you might quote Thomas Watson's point that òwhen a proprietor gives up manual labour he soon becomes a born masterù'. Introducing and Concluding Quotations Never include a quotation in an essay without introducing it. You need to lead your examiners smoothly into a quotation allowing them time to make the transition from your own words to those of others. Never simply cast a quote into your argument. If you are quoting from an academic book for example always include a phrase like òAs Raymond Williams argues' or òFredric Jameson has written that' or òAs Mary Wollstonecraft once stated'. At the end of the quoted sentence or passage always ensure that you place punctuation outside the inverted commas; that is the comma or full stop that follows the quotation should not fall inside the quotation marks (as typically it will not be in the original passage). When to Indent If a quotation is only a sentence (or two short sentences) include that quotation in the continuous body of the text; if the quotation is longer then you need to indent it. Example Beardwell and Holden (2001 p. 105) describe peripheral workers as those who òwill supply skills that are easily obtainable in the external labour market and their co-operation in the production process is not critical to organisational performance'. OR The first and primary workgroup are usually associated with firm-specific skills and so represent the most valued workers to the organisation. Beardwell and Holden (2001 p. 105) make the point that: The key supposition of the flexible firm concept is that the firm becomes much more responsive to changes in its product markets if the workforce is structured into two main groups. The size and composition of the core will depend on organisational decisions on work organisation and the design of jobs since core worker status applies mainly to those supplying firm specific skills. NB: For an indented quotation you do not include quotation marks (unless it is dialogue). Also note that you leave a gap of a line before and after the indented quote.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/18/kbrm3014-business-research-methodology/,INTRODUCTION Long gone are the days of the barter system which was once used throughout the entire world. Now the practice of physically buying products is soon dwindling down as the digital age of technology is changing the way people purchase their goods (Cui 2016). The popularity of online shopping is slowly dominating the way consumers purchase goods as the years go by. This creates many opportunities out there for businesses to market and sell their products effectively on online shopping platforms to be known easily and ease the way on how consumers purchase things. However with new opportunities also comes with some possible drawbacks such as online impulse buying. Chan et al. (2017) stated that online shopping releases consumers from any physical constraints when shopping in retail and in turn leading to impulse buying. 1.1 DEFINITION OF TERMS 1.1.1 IMPULSE BUYING BEHAVIOR Impulsive buying is defined as instigating an internal or external stimuli to make a sudden act of purchase (Sharma 2019). Most likely their thoughts are to be unreflective dominated by emotional attraction of the desired product prompted by physical proximity and trusted by the belief of immediate gratification. Although in accordance with Chathuranga and Lakshika (2019) it is a persuasive sudden and hedonically complex buying behaviour where the rapidity of an impulse decision process precludes thoughtful as well as deliberate consideration of alternative information or options. The term itself is generally considered synonymous with unplanned buyingù that describes shopping made without prior planning in advance. Building on this thought L∂nnberg and Milton (2020) perceives impulse purchases as emotional therefore non-rational resulting in declining thoughts while consumed with the guilt of losing control. Impulse buying behavior exists in both forms of physical shopping and ecommerce (Zhang Xu Zhao and Yu 2018). The latter comes with higher potential for impulse buying due to rapid social media growth arising a new implementation of marketing efforts thus highly affecting consumer behaviour (Alalwan et.al 2017; Dwivedi et.al 2015; Kapoor et al. 2018. Cited in Wu et.al 2020). Evidently the most severe difference between traditional shopping services and electronics are the replacement of human interactions with machines. Hence it is perceived that the online experience is viewed as more impersonal and automated with fewer sensory stimulations (L∂nnberg & Milton 2020). Both store environments create drastically different shopping experiences even if similar products are being purchased. 1.1.2 SENSORY MARKETING The term sensory marketing is referred by Sharma (2019) as marketing that engages with a consumer's senses and affects perception judgement as well as behaviour entirely. In the phenomenon that a human being's five senses of taste smell sight sound and touch are all engaged it will possibly form retain as well as revisit their past memories (Hussain 2017). Sensory marketing plays a crucial role in influencing consumer behavior in a way that it utilizes these natural human instincts as a tactic to promote products and services by creating such an environment that appeals to senses at the point of sale. Chathuranga and Lakshika (2019) also emphasized that the stimulating positive sensorial emotional states and providing customers with favourable shopping experiences within the store have the ability to amplify the tendency of impulse purchase. Hence sensory marketing can be beneficial for marketers as it enhances a consumer's awareness of the intangible attributes of a product such as its price quality reliability beauty and aesthetics. Rook and Fisher (1995) study survey found that a person who is responsive to their cognitive state is less likely to engage in impulsive buying while those who respond to their affective state show impulse buying behavior. Such that this study is further supported by results of findings that impulsive customers are more likely to put their emotions first compared to non-impulsive consumers as this affective state of mind triggers impulsive buying (Dholakia 2000; Youn and Faber 2000). Further in the literature we will further extend the research of the influencing factors of impulse buying as it consists of both endogenous and exogenous factors. Endogenous factors are in-store browsing positive or negative effects and the spontaneous urge or impulse of buying something (Zhao et al. 2019; Beatty and Ferrel1998). While exogenous factors consist of environment variables (time and money) and individual differences (impulsivity and self-construction) as stated by a study by (Zhang and Shrum 2009; White et al. 2011). Environment variables cover the availability of money time and the physical environment. Consumer's decision is strongly influenced by their economic situation while time is the availability of time that a consumer has while shopping (Nandha    Read less,KBRM3014 Business Research Methodology

You should also include a List of References (not a Bibliography). This is a list of references from which you have cited in the main body of your essay. It is not included in the wordcount. Read the Assignment Assessment Criteria and accompanying guidelines below for further guidance as to what is being looked for. Explanation of Assessment Criteria 1. Demonstrating an in-depth understanding of the functions and issues raised. Have you identified and discussed the major issues raised by the question? The answers to all of the questions require reference to major issues facing digital marketing strategists today. They will all require you to go beyond or to develop further issues mentioned in lectures. Your answer must demonstrate that you understand in depth digital marketing strategy and the particular issues addressed by the question. This will often be both in theoretical terms and in practical terms understanding the difficulties these issues pose for digital marketers (such as data or organisational or implementation issues). Does your answer have an appropriate scope? Eg If it was connected with digital marketing are social media wireless digital and push digital such as email considered as well as websites? 2. Use of examples Do you use examples? Are your examples of real named organisations (eg Apple British Airways) networks (eg Facebook) or media (eg a specific email campaign)? Just naming networks is not enough  we want other examples too. Some of your examples must be of real named organisations. Are they relevant to the points you are making? Are they used well so that they really make the points you're making clearer? Is it clear where they came from eg referenced to a source anecdotal (someone told you) your own experience. Are they treated critically for example do you evaluate whether they were successful? 3. Skills of Critical Evaluation Students who merely repeat or describe basic theory or the arguments of others will lose marks here. Instead we wish to see you use evidence from the research or arguments of others to support arguments which you develop yourself. You must be able to critically evaluate established theory or commonly held assumptions or the arguments of others and show with justification where they are good where they may be inadequate and where they have been developed further by others. This may also involve analysis of data you discover (although you are not expected to undertake primary research). We do not want just a string of paraphrases or quotations of others' work. We wish to see you interpret and use such sources critically and intelligently to build and support your arguments about the issues raised in the question. In other words we wish to see you display Masters-level skills of critical evaluation which you will have used in other similar assignments on your programme. The easiest way to think of this is I must be evaluative.ù This may involve you evaluating an example as good practice useful has flaws poor practice; or evaluating a source as useful introducing new ideas developing the work of others leaving questions unanswered giving insufficient or inappropriate evidence drawing conclusions unjustified by the evidence.

The Seneca Way's business office & supplies warehouse are located at 8 The Seneca WayMarkham Ontario. Important internal environmental factors: Staffing an event: Your company hires staff for its events from a staffing roster which is a list of the people you know & trust for working at events. When an event is booked you contact the people on the roster that you need to work at the event tell them the date/location and book them. They are always free if it fits in their weekly availability listed in the roster and if the event is in the GTA. Your staff are responsible for their own transportation to and from the events that you schedule them to work at their own cost. They are not paid for their transportation time. Note: You are not competing with the other groups in hiring your team members from the staffing roster list; they are all available to you. Supplies for events: Your company has a large inventory of supplies that you can check-out for use at events at no cost. The inventory is made up of: A large stock of tableware (flatware and silverware; porcelain plates dishes and soup bowls; cups and saucers; glasses and stemware etc.); serving utensils bowls and platters; urns for hot drinks; they are all available in two grades (regular & fancy); white and black table cloths Rectangular and round collapsible tables seating 6 & 8; chairs suitable for indoor and outdoor use Waste bins and garbage bags (waste disposal is available at the warehouse) The supplies are all stored at the warehouse.

Vehicles: The company leases two 2020 Ford Transit full-size cargo vans and you can check them out for transporting supplies to event venues. When not in use they are parked at the warehouse. There is a corporate cost of $145 per vehicle per event charged to each event's budget. Quotes and billing: The corporate standard for how to calculate a quote is as follows: First calculate the total costs (for the staffing catering vehicle(s) applicable equipment/supplies) add a 40% mark-up and then round up to the next amount divisible by $10. The difference between the total costs and the quote is The Seneca Way's profit. HST is applicable on the quote. Step one There has been a call as follows: A prospective client is interested in hiring The Seneca Way for a small outdoor formal reception (up to 36 attendees) this spring in Toronto. A copy of the client's letter requesting a quotation will be published on emailprotected at 9:00 am on the morning of the day after class in Week #10.

Note: SMOG = (S)imple (M)easure (O)f (G)obbledgook Determine the SMOG readability level for the following passage. Fear appeals are based on the behavioural learning theory that the threatening message arouses fear (or some other emotional state). This is then reduced if the individual complies with the recommended behaviour.  There is a general consensus that utilising fear appeal to persuade people to cease undesired behaviours might work under certain conditions. But much literature provides contradictory findings on this issue. The questions fear-inducing messages raise mainly concern the efficacy of fear appeal in real life scenarios (as opposed to laboratory studies) and the ethical reason for concern. The ethical question is whether people can be hurt or damaged by them.  Several studies suggest use of positive appeals as an alternative to fear appeal. However positive appeal has not received as much attention as fear appeal and there has been minimal research into the effectiveness of positive appeal. Furthermore no studies have compared which of the two appeals are more effective. On the basis of the aforementioned this thesis will focus on the use of emotional appeals in social marketing campaigns. ***I have attached the powerpoint slides for the homework.

Conclusion: (250 words -10 marks) Case: Debbie is a 39 year woman who has a 12 year old son Oscar from her first marriage. Oscar's teacher had reported to Debbie he had noticed Oscar's behaviour and grades were declining at school and he appears to be disengaging from his peers. HARRY is 42 years old and is Debbie's new partner. Harry has a 7-year-old son Jack and his daughter Jessie is nearly 2 years old: they are the children from his previous relationship. Jack and Jessie stay every second week and have mostly adjusted well to this new arrangement. Harry is currently not working after an accident at work six months ago. Harry can put his hand to most things and has been making several home products with recycled timber and selling them at the market and a local shop. Debbie works as a schoolteacher at the local primary school and has just confirmed she is pregnant with their first child. Finances are tight but Debbie is very good at budgeting for the family. Debbie was able to buy a home from the settlement from her previous marriage and enjoys living in a small rural community about 40 minutes from the next large town. Debbie and Harry have decided to work hard at creating a positive family unit. Therefore they have regular family meetings to create a solid foundation for the whole family. They plan family fun times: family games at the local park on Sundays and camping. Family special events like birthdays are always celebrated together. Oscar and Jack also have chores to attend daily and are rewarded for completing them. These rewards can be pocket money or another negotiated reward. The family always have their evening meals together at the table. The television is off and they talk about their day. Any challenges are talked through in an open and supportive environment. There are lots of conversations about the new baby arriving. Oscar (12) has two good friends he has known since they attended pre-school together. They often enjoy getting together on weekends to ride their bikes and are on the same football team. Harry loves going to watch Oscar play football and will usually also take Jack to watch. Oscar is increasingly wanting his independence and is starting to challenge parental decisions. Oscar took a little while to adjust to his new family but now mostly enjoys the responsibility of his younger siblings. He is also enjoying a positive relationship with and is role modelling his stepfather Harry. Harry likes to take the boys camping and adventuring. These adventures have been a wonderful bonding time and allowed Harry to talk with Oscar about school issues. Oscar's biological father has little to do with Oscar. Jack (7) is a happy outgoing little boy who has recently commenced at his new òbig' school. He enjoys his new òbig' brother especially when they play òcatch ball' together or any game that is filled with fantasy and drama. Jack is also finding new friends through his school. He loves going to the park close by to ride his bike. Jack loves being active but does get tired by the end of the day and enjoys a story and early to bed. Jack has recently started sometimes wetting the bed but is mostly not distressed by this. Jack is quite protective of his little sister. Jessie (22 months) attends day-care two days a week. She is walking and has lots of new words. She likes to try and choose her clothes and dress herself. She is also starting to toilet train. Jessie loves to play with her brothers; she really enjoys playing òcups of tea' car racing or exploring around where her brothers are playing. She enjoys games of chase and hide and seek. Jessie does have some difficulties around times of òchange-over' between families. The family does not have any close family nearby but does have a few good friends. Family History: Debbie's mother died of breast cancer aged 58 5 years ago. Debbie's father Peter (65) is living in the family home 1000kms away. He has just retired from being a school principal. He has struggled with depression since losing his wife. Debbie has one older brother Brendan (41) who is married to Lisa (37) and they have a boy aged 12 and to girls 10 and 4. Brendan and Lisa live in the same town as Peter. Peter has only met Harry twice and is happy that Debbie is finally feeling more settled and happier in her life. Peter is looking forward to a new grandchild. Harry's ex-partner lives fairly nearby and they continue a mostly amicable relationship. They mostly share financial costs for the children as well as custody. Harry's parents Julie (65) and Michael (66) are fit and well and currently travelling Australia in their campervan. Harry has three siblings; Alex (40) Betty (38) and Amy (36). Alex has three children with her partner Charlie Betty has two children and Amy has two children  so lots of cousins. Harry has had a close relationship with his siblings and parents and enjoys their twice yearly family get together. They always meet up at a destination that has been a family tradition since Harry was a child. Harry's parents were sad at his first relationship break up but have accepted Debbie well and are looking forward to their new grandchild coming.    Read less,NURS2003 Nursing|Family Tradition

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/22/busi-3052-intermediate-financial-accounting-ii/,Identify your Role One of the first steps is to identify your role in the case. Are you an independent auditor? Part of a management team? An advisor? The role is important as it dictates various aspects of your analysis and response including which user's goals you try to accomplish and the tone/style of the report. Identify the Required Tasks Identify what exactly is being asked of you and be sure to address all of the required tasks! You may have to read the case carefully to find the embedded Requiredù. Understand the Financial Reporting Landscape (User's Needs Analysis) The user needs analysis is important as it guides your analysis and recommendations. As an employee consultant etc you should try to meet the user's needs (usually within the confines of GAAP). Identify the users of the financial statements / financial information Identify the user's needs (be specific) Rank and prioritize the user's needs Addressing the Reporting Issue Once you understand your role and the financial reporting landscape you can properly identify analyze and make recommendations to the reporting issues. The following approach is suggested: 1. Issue: Identify the reporting issue and state why it is an issue. 2. Implication: Determine the implications of the issue. It is good to use both quantitative and qualitative analysis to fully understand the implication. Be specific and make use of case facts! 3. Alternatives: Generate viable and reasonable alternatives that are within GAAP. It is usually not useful to generate alternatives outside of GAAP because they are not available options. The case facts will help you generate alternatives. 4. Recommendation: Based on the user needs make a viable recommendation to the address the reporting issue. Be specific. Your recommendation must flow logically from your analysis. Because the users' needs form the major criteria to evaluate the alternatives they also provide the support for your recommendation. Take a Step Back and Be Aware of any Big Picture Issues or Biases When analyzing the financial reporting issues try to be alert for any big picture issues or reporting bias. For example is there a going concern issue when combining all issues together? Is the controller or another manager trying to maximize net income to have a higher bonus business value etc?

What Mr. Keskkula's goal is in considering the new compensation plan. ii. How the consultant's recommendation for the purchasing department matches this goal: 2. Go to the discussion board and post an answer to the question posted there. This assignment is worth 5 marks and is due by end of day Thursday November 18th. I have included a rubric showing how I will evaluate your posts. Hannes Keskkula the president of European Delicatessen Products Inc. (EDP) was considering a consultant's report on management compensation. The growth of EDP had led him to ask the consultant to review the company's operations and management compensation plans.  He had started EDP six years ago with a small loan from his parents believing that there was an untapped demand in Canada for eastern European food products. The growth of EDP had justified his confidence: starting with just two employees and a small warehouse in Okotoks Alta. EDP had grown to a $100-million-a-year business employing 300 people across Canada; before-tax profits in 2019 were $26 million. EDP had three main operational departments: purchasing warehousing and distribution and sales. Every six months EDP's management team met to discuss plans for the upcoming six months. The sales team was responsible for preparing a sales budget based on estimates of demand for various products; based on this budget the purchasing team was responsible for preparing a purchasing plan based on expected market prices. EDP's Executive Committee which included Keskkula the vice-president of finance the vice-president of sales and the vice-president of purchasing then reviewed and approved the combined sales and purchasing plan. The purchasing team were acknowledged experts at finding supply sources and at negotiating favourable prices that provided EDP with a well-priced supply of goods while maintaining excellent relationships with suppliers; these relationships were useful when EDP was faced with unexpectedly high demand or when market or production issues led to shortages. EDP had always paid each of its managers a salary plus a bonus based on the company's profitability. The consultant however had pointed out to Keskkula that compensation should match responsibility and that many factors affecting profitability were beyond any one manager's control. The consultant had recommended for example that compensation for the managers in the purchasing department be based on variances in cost from the purchasing plan giving them an incentive to source product at the lowest possible price. Keskkula needed to decide whether to replace the current profit-based compensation plan with the new model.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/22/mgmt410-strategic-management-digital-technology-expansion/,LBS is a textile firm that designs fabrics for the wholesale market in the Northeast. The company over the last decade experienced modest growth after importing goods from the East but is now encountering much more significant competition from Asia. Almost all weaving plants in the U.S. have closed and price discounts from the East are forcing many firms to consider importing fabrics from abroad and to go directly to the weavers as opposed to LBS.  LBS needs to consider a number of ways to expand its operation but will need to invest in digital technology expansion. It has little experience with technology and currently has a 500 users system running a Microsoft network (they currently have 600 employees). The firm has a homegrown wholesale distribution and accounting system using a very old legacy system. LBS is thinking of replacing the system to help support a business proposal to expand operations to the West coast. The expansion requires a 25% increase in personnel. There is also a need to consider more e-business and digital systems to operate with weaving plants in China. The current network infrastructure is outdated machines need to be replaced telephone systems need to be updated and delivery/import systems need to be constructed.  LBS only has an operating budget of $50 million and a capital budget of $5 million. After careful analysis of the business proposal you as the Technology executive have determined that the following cost investments are required: Capital investments in equipment and operating systems $8 M Personnel additions in IT $1 M Application Software (accounting fulfillment etc.) $2 M E-business systems $4 M R&D in textile design and new advanced products $3 M Telephone and wireless technology $.5 M Travel training and misc $1 M Total Funding $19.5 M Thus the investment in relation to the budgets is enormous. You have been asked to issue a report to management on your proposal; no one knows these numbers. Obviously LBS will need to finance this level of investment. You expect there to be many questions relating to why these investments are needed. You recognize that you would have no more than 30 minutes to present your report. Based on the limited information you have provide your report broken into the following sections: Direct Revenue investments: what are the investments that can be measured against financial returns? You can assume such returns will be feasible and meet company standards.  You must reference the financial measurements that we have reviewed in class and in your readings. Indirect returns: using Lucas' methods of non-monetary valuation show the benefits from those investments that can be allocated to returns in some wayîand how you will do it. Cost of business issues: using Lucas' Garbage Can Model and Conversion effectiveness provide your argument as to why these investments are important. Focus on what we have discussed in class and what you have read. Although you have some understanding of the amount of investment related to normal operating and capital investments concentrate on the generic issues of what is challenging the business and what brings value.  You can assume that you are 100% convinced of your planîso you must reflect an enthusiasm and confidence in your report. You do not need to use the Lucas calculation metric. Further your report cannot contain any diagrams or chartsthat is it must be descriptive in nature. Assessment Your paper should be able to reflect what you would want to cover during a 30-minute presentationîso you should stay between 5 and 10 pages for this assignment.

It has been estimated in some research that half of those complications are avoidable. The Director of Clinical Governance in your health service wants a literature review completed of publications internationally that report on incidence of adverse events or complications to patients who are in hospitals (in-patients). You need to complete a standard or narrative literature review; include materials published within the last 10 years; include publications in both academic and the grey literature. The Director wants a strong and comprehensive literature review completed that includes both the identifications of publications about adverse events or harm to patients in hospitals and also your review analysis on the findings in terms of your summary and analysis of the key information from those published results.

Read the following case study carefully. It is adapted from a true story. Hannah first started working as a nursery nurse but after witnessing the care and compassion provided to a family member after a stroke decided to come and work in social care. She started working as a domiciliary care worker in a small family-owned business and has since progressed through a number of managerial roles to become a head of care services. She's now part of a development team overseeing the building of a new care service to support people with dementia. She's never studied management or leadership and she is both worried and excited about a new project where she is involved in the design and planning of a new facility to support 30 people with dementia in a specialist dementia suite and 49 extra care apartments for those in need of extra care. She will be working closely with the architects and various tradespeople and will soon be recruiting the wide range of staff needed: carers administration and reception maintenance domestic and catering. Her role also involves: ¢ managing a team of registered managers who run their own care services. ¢ supporting the chief executive officer and working with the director of shared services and head of housing. ¢ working with CQC and local authorities to ensure that all services are compliant and meet regulatory standards. ¢ dealing with compliments and complaints in relation to the care and operational services. ¢ developing a training strategy and training resources for the organisation. Hannah really enjoys managing a team and is very motivated to develop team members in their roles but she realises that she needs to gain a deep insight and understanding of leadership related to her new project. She decides to write a 4000-word formal business style report for her team that highlights those aspects of leadership relevant to project to ensure that there is a shared understanding and context of leadership and teams. The report will address the following areas: 1. Examine the role of leadership in leading teams. 2. Analyse the value of using theoretical models relevant to when building a successful team. 3. Explain the stages of team development and the leadership style at each stage to achieve a successful project outcome. 4. Provide recommendations for open communication between team members to support team development.    Read less,HCR5004 Leading Teams in Health of Leadership
https://scribing.shop/2021/11/23/ifsm311-enterprise-architecture-and-stakeholder-involvement/,This assignment gives you the opportunity to apply your understanding of the course concepts to analyze how the enterprise architecture (EA) affects various elements of the organization. This assignment specifically addresses the following course outcome: Conduct stakeholder analysis to identify concerns and appropriate viewpoints One of the keys to successful enterprise architecture (EA) implementation is the support offered by important stakeholders. Stakeholders are those with an interest in a given project. There are varying degrees of stakeholder involvement which may be described as being in the following groups: Key Players These are the most important stakeholders; they have a vested interest in the approach content and output of the EA. Keep Satisfied The next most significant group are those who must obtain what they need from the EA and are less concerned with the construction and specific content of the EA. ¢ Keep InformedîThis group has a need to know what is being done and how it will benefit the organization overall; they have little interest in any of the details of how the EA is developed and used. ¢ Minimal EffortîThis group has little interest in the EA and requires little attention during the EA development effort. The benefits of successfully managing stakeholders include the following: ¢ Obtaining support from the most influential stakeholders will help ensure that they both help to shape the EA and to improve its content and products. ¢ Influential stakeholders are in a position to allocate human and financial resources to the EA effort making it more likely to succeed. ¢ Ongoing communication with stakeholders ensures their understanding of the process and benefits of EA and enables their support if needed. ¢ Successful management allows the EA team to draw on the support of stakeholders with a positive view of the process if they need to address negative reactions or setbacks in the organization. Using the DMV Case Study and the Stakeholder Analysis Exercise spreadsheet provided you are to complete the columns of the spreadsheet for each of the ten stakeholder groups listed on the spreadsheet. Please refer to the reading link in your Course 5 content area called: TOGAF Standard: Stakeholder Management. This link provides some excellent insights into the different roles and influences of the stakeholders to assist in your assignment. Again this is just a reference for your benefit. First explain the interest or concern that the stakeholder has in the development of the EA. Then identify their classù or role in the EA as one of the four shown above (Key Player Keep Satisfied Keep Informed or Minimal Effort). Finally explain your reasoning for selecting the class/role that you did. Important: You are not being graded on whether you picked the correctù stakeholder involvement (i.e. key player keep satisfied keep informed or minimal effort). You might see your Security Officer as a key player or as a stakeholder needing to be kept informed. This is fine. What is important is that you provide a solid reason for why you chose this classification as it relates to the interest/concern area. Please only pick one classù or role per stakeholder.

It is a 60 credit module and core. Proposal 2000-2500 words-this is essentially for you to inform us about what the project is about Introduction/Topic-really why the project is off interest to you and how might it benefit those concerned and initial research objectives/questions Literature review-a brief review of key literature sources and areas in marketing that might be further read into. These books might not have been read yet but at least you are aware of the literature you will need to research. Project methodology- the rationale for primary research methods you will use for example interviews or surveys and also a brief focus on initial reading for secondary research. Also ethics issues and possible limitations. Conclusion-any final assumptions you are making expected outcomes etc. The idea for the project can come from several places; ¢ Discussions with colleagues ¢ Discussions with friends ¢ Issues you identify that are making your workplace /industry difficult ¢ Trade newsletters/company newsletters/ trade newspapers national press or media ¢ Students in the classroom ¢ Case studies from previous modules ¢ Modules in which you really enjoyed/understood the subject ¢ TV-documentaries news ¢ Web searches for marketing issues Sometimes your own employers are keen to get involved and this can be helpful for interviews and primary research. Others have little if no interest and so your research has to be self- driven. There is no specific type of òproject ò we discuss your ideas during the first 2 sessions of the module in the Autumn term 2020 and then advise but in the past many projects have focused on; ¢ Processes  generally improvements in the workplace marketing systems ¢ Change in the marketing field ¢ Client/customer focus ¢ Working with suppliers such as problems of conflict bureaucratic requirements etc. ¢ Theory vs. Implementation for example you might want to look at a marketing theory and transfer it to another culture/country industry or update ¢ External factors that impact on marketing practice such as legal issues social change economics etc. ¢ Specific subjects-social media brands market entry etc.    Read less,BUMN108d6 Marketing Project| Secondary Research

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/24/psc130-political-science-and-economic-growth/,China's increasingly aggressive posture towards the South China Sea and the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea is less important in itself than as a sign of things to come. For six decades after the second world war an American Pax Pacificaù has provided the security and economic framework within which Asian countries have produced the most rapid economic growth in history. However having emerged as a great power that will overtake the US in the next decade to become the largest economy in the world it is not surprising that China will demand revisions to the rules established by others. The defining question about global order in the decades ahead will be: can China and the US escape Thucydides's trap? The historian's metaphor reminds us of the dangers two parties face when a rising power rivals a ruling power  as Athens did in 5th century BC and Germany did at the end of the 19th century. Most such challenges have ended in war. Peaceful cases required huge adjustments in the attitudes and actions of the governments and the societies of both countries involved. Classical Athens was the centre of civilisation. Philosophy history drama architecture democracy  all beyond anything previously imagined. This dramatic rise shocked Sparta the established land power on the Peloponnese. Fear compelled its leaders to respond. Threat and counter-threat produced competition then confrontation and finally conflict. At the end of 30 years of war both states had been destroyed. Thucydides wrote of these events: It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable.ù Note the two crucial variables: rise and fear. The rapid emergence of any new power disturbs the status quo. In the 21st century as Harvard University's Commission on American National Interests has observed about China a diva of such proportions cannot enter the stage without effectù. Never has a nation moved so far so fast up the international rankings on all dimensions of power. In a generation a state whose gross domestic product was smaller than Spain's has become the second-largest economy in the world. If we were betting on the basis of history the answer to the question about Thucydides's trap appears obvious. In 11 of 15 cases since 1500 where a rising power emerged to challenge a ruling power war occurred. Think about Germany after unification as it overtook Britain as Europe's largest economy. In 1914 and in 1939 its aggression and the UK's response produced world wars. Uncomfortable as China's rise is for the US there is nothing unnatural about an increasingly powerful China demanding more say and greater sway in relations among nations. Americans particularly those who lecture Chinese about being more like usù should reflect on our own history. As the US emerged as the dominant power in the western hemisphere in about 1890 how did it behave? Future president Theodore Roosevelt personified a nation supremely confident that the next 100 years would be an American century. In the years before the first world war the US liberated Cuba threatened Britain and Germany with war to force them to accept US positions on disputes in Venezuela and Canada backed an insurrection that split Columbia to create a new state of Panama  which immediately gave the US concessions to build the Panama Canal  and attempted to overthrow the government of Mexico which was supported by the UK and financed by London bankers. In the half century that followed US military forces intervened in our hemisphereù on more than 30 separate occasions to settle economic or territorial disputes on terms favourable to Americans or oust leaders we judged unacceptable. To recognise powerful structural factors is not to argue that leaders are prisoners of the iron laws of history. It is rather to help us appreciate the magnitude of the challenge. If leaders in China and the US perform no better than their predecessors in classical Greece or Europe at the beginning of the 20th century historians of the 21st century will cite Thucydides in explaining the catastrophe that follows. The fact that war would be devastating for both nations is relevant but not decisive. Recall the first world war in which all the combatants lost what they treasured most. In light of the risks of such an outcome leaders in both China and the US must begin talking to each other much more candidly about likely confrontations and flash points. Even more difficult and painful both must begin making substantial adjustments to accommodate the irreducible requirements of the other.    Read less,PSC130 Political Science and Economic Growth

Boasting 100 en-suite bedrooms a sizeable restaurant an outdoor swimming pool and a nine-hole golf course the hotel has remained an independent family-run business for over 70 years. Its hey-day was in the 1950s and 1960s when wealthy clients from all over the world would rub shoulders with high-profile celebrities and members of royal families in its chic cocktail bar overlooking the sea. Barnacles still returns a profit but its old school charm is now waning fast and its glamorous past is increasingly fading from people's memories. This has not been helped by the COVID-19 pandemic. The business retains a loyal clientele however who come back to stay year after year and still plan to do so in future. Many local families too remain very fond of its traditional Sunday lunch menu which is now a take- away favourite. However these groups are now ageing quite quickly and are diminishing in number. What is more a big new threat is now looming on the horizon. Peacock Hall  a large stately home a few miles away from Barnacles  has recently been converted into a plush four-star hotel and is about to open its doors with a loud fanfare of publicity as soon as the pandemic allows. With its health spa leisure club stunning bridal suite and hi-tech conference facilities Peacock Hall represents a potential serious threat. For the first time in its history Barnacles will soon be facing some serious direct local competition. Barnacles is a major local employer having always preferred if it can to employ people from nearby communities. Of its 75 staff 55 come from its immediate locality. The remaining 20 are mostly from overseas from Europe and are employed on a live-in basis occupying a range of cottages located on the estate. Employee turnover is very low in comparison with most hotels a majority of its staff having worked at Barnacles for over five years. They know the regular clients well and enjoy serving them in their established easy-going and rather informal style. Absence levels are also low. In short the staff are a highly committed loyal and well-motivated team.

Rita is deeply committed to the business having worked in it all her adult life but she is painfully aware that major change will need to be introduced quite quickly if it is to prosper and survive in the future  especially with BREXIT requirements. To that end she has secured substantial funding from the bank to finance a wholesale refurbishment of the hotel. There will soon be new carpets new furnishings new decor and a new indoor pool with a sauna and gymnasium close by. A new more modern menu has also been created alongside a more extensive (and much more expensive) wine list. But Rita knows that all this investment will be wasted if Barnacles does not also smarten up its act as far as its standards of service are concerned. Only if that too is moved up-market will Barnacles be able to compete effectively with Peacock Hall. What is more the hotel is going to have to become a great deal more efficient in its operations if it is to be put on a sound future financial footing. It is also going to have to develop far greater organisational agility so that it can take swift advantage of new business opportunities whenever they arise. There are some particular staffing issues which Rita believes are symptomatic of the wider challenges that Barnacles faces: ¢ There is far too much slack time. The staff almost all of whom are employed on fulltime permanent contracts tend to be kept very active for a few hours each day when their departments are busy but seem to spend the rest of their shifts chatting to one another and to the regular guests. This has not really changed during the pandemic with non-furloughed staff still finding time to chat. ¢ By contrast when the hotel is busy (e.g.: in the summer months at Christmas time at weekends when it is hosting weddings and banquets  and more recently take out for their famous Friday Curry) staff are run off their feet. Long social distanced queues develop in the restaurant and at reception. At these times the hotel appears understaffed and this is a major source of customer complaints. ¢ Standards of cleanliness are not good enough especially given the Health and Safety concerns of COVID. Too often guests are checked into rooms that have not been serviced sufficiently thoroughly and have to be moved when they complain. Attention to detail has also lacked during big banquets. Guests sometimes get served the wrong dishes or food which is cold. This is unacceptable given the amount of money they are paying. ¢ Reports which Rita recently commissioned from two òmystery shoppers' make painful reading. While the hotel scored highly for its friendliness these guests felt that they were kept waiting too long for service and that employees were often unwilling to fulfil perfectly reasonable requests for items such as more lavatory paper de-caffeinated coffee and a map of the locality. òCharming but inflexible' was the verdict of one mystery shopper. Rita Clement has recently appointed a new HR and Training Manager at Barnacles in the hopes to turn things around through change management and organisational development. However Rita stresses that she is very keen to introduce the changes that are necessary without damaging staff morale or their level of engagement. While becoming more responsive flexible and professional in its approach Barnacles must retain its reputation for friendliness along with its existing customers.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/24/mis607-cybersecurityinitial-report-organisation/,Task Summary Reflecting on your initial report (A2) the organisation has decided to continue to employ you for the next phase: risk analysis and development of the mitigation plan. The organisation has become aware that the Australia Government (AG) has developed strict privacy requirements for business. The company wishes you to produce a brief summary of these based on real- world Australian government requirements (similar to how you used real-world information in A2 for the real-world attack). These include the Australian Privacy Policies (APPs) especially the requirements on notifiable data breaches. The APP wanst you to examine these requirements and advise them on their legal requirements. Also ensure that your threat list includes attacks on customer data breaches. The company wishes to know if the GDPR applies to them. The word count for this assessment is 2500 words (¬±10%) not counting tables or figures. Tables and figures must be captioned (labelled) and referred to by caption. Caution: Items without a caption may be treated as if they are not in the report. Be careful not to use up word count discussing cybersecurity basics. This is not an exercise in summarising your class notes and such material will not count towards marks. You can cover theory outside the classes. Requirements Assessment 3 (A3) is in many ways a continuation of A2. You will start with the threat list from A2 although feel free to make changes to the threat list if it is not suitable for A3. You may need to include threats related to privacy concerns. Beginning with the threat list: ¢ You need to align threats/vulnerabilities as much as possible with controls. MIS607_Assessment_3_Brief_Mitogation Report_ Module 6.1 Page 2 of 4 ¢ Perform a risk analysis and determine controls to be employed. ¢ Combine the controls into a project of mitigation. ¢ Give advice on the need for ongoing cybersecurity after your main mitigation steps. Note: ¢ You must use the risk matrix approach covered in classes. Remember risk = likelihood x consequence. ¢ You should show evidence of gathering data on likelihood and consequence for each threat identified. You should briefly explain how this was done. ¢ At least one of the risks must be so trivial and/or expensive to control that you decide not to use it (in other words in this case accept the risk). At least one of the risks but obviously not all. ¢ Provide cost estimates for the controls including policy or training controls. You can make up these values but try to justify at least one of the costs (if possible use links to justify costs). Reference Requirement A3 requires at least 5 references (but as many as you like above this number) with at least 3 references coming from peer-reviewed sources: conferences or journals. (You can put a star *ù after these in the reference section if you want to highlight which are peer reviewed.) One of the peer-reviewed articles must be uploaded in pdf format along with the A3 report (this can be done in BB). This pdf will be referred to here as the nominated articleù. (Zero marks for referencing if the nominated article is not itself peer-reviewed.)

He has also overstated the value of the assets of some companies in the group. As soon as the meeting has ended Joe who is the chairman of the board phones his wife Jane and tells her to contact their stockbroker and instruct him to sell 65% of his (Joe's) shares in Green Group Ltd and all of Jane's shares in the company. He does not give her any reason for this instruction but she immediately realises that there must be serious problems in the company because she knows that he was attending a board meeting that morning. She duly instructs the stockbroker as requested by her husband. The stockbroker Jay also realizes that Jane or her husband must know something that will badly affect the share price of the company and sells some shares in Green Group Ltd owned by clients whose share accounts he is managing. When the true state of affairs at Green Group Ltd is revealed by an investigative journalist one week later its share price falls by 80%.

(Provide 500 words answer) With reference to the relevant legislation and case law provide a detailed critical analysis of the requirements to declare a director to be delinquent or under probation in terms of the Companies Act 71 of 2008. In your answer you must consider whether the provisions of s162 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 create an appropriate balance between the interests of the different parties or whether in your view they are too onerous and will discourage appropriate people from agreeing to be appointed as directors. (Provide 500 words answer) After a final order for the winding up of Futile (Pty) Ltd was issued and a final liquidator appointed an executive director of the company has now filed an application with court for the company to be placed in business rescue. He argues that as an employee of the company he is an affected person who has the necessary locus standi to apply for a business rescue order. Furthermore he informs the liquidator that the liquidation proceedings have now been suspended by the business rescue application and the liquidator no longer has any authority over the management of the company and its assets. These functions must either be returned to the previous board or control must be handed over to the business rescue practitioner nominated in the application. Frank who holds 30% of the claims against the company is opposing the business rescue application. He bases his opposition to the application on the following grounds: Frank believes that a business rescue application cannot be brought after a final liquidation order has been issued. He intends voting against any plan that may be proposed by a rescue practitioner because he does not believe that it is possible to rescue the company. Since he holds 30% of the vote no rescue plan can be approved without his support even if the court grants the application for commencement of business rescue proceedings.

(4 Points) Tito's Handmade Vodka of Austin is considering expanding its production capacity by purchasing new distilling equipment. The firm has just completed a $10000 feasibility study to analyze the decision to buy the equipment resulting in the following estimates: Capital Expenditures: The cost of the distilling equipment is $100000 and needs to be paid immediately (i.e. year 0). The equipment will last for ten years. The firm expects to recover a salvage value of $10000 in year 10 (i.e. 10 years from now). Marketing: Once the equipment is operating in year 1 the extra capacity is expected to generate $100000 in additional sales in each of the subsequent ten years (i.e. year 1 year 2 ‚ year 10). Operations: The disruption caused by the installation will decrease sales revenues by $20000 in year 0. The costs of goods (COGS) sold are 60% of their sales revenues. The increased production will require additional inventory on hand of $20000 to be added in year 0. You will continue to need the inventory of $20000 until year 9 and it will be fully recovered in year 10 (i.e. the required inventory will be zero in year 10). The firm expects receivables to be 20% of revenues and payables to be 10% of the COGS. Human Resources: The expansion will require additional sales and administrative costs of $10000 per year from year 1 through year 10. Accounting: The equipment will be depreciated equally every year over the 10-year life of the equipment. Thus the book value after depreciation in year 10 will be zero.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/25/hrm4022n-learning-and-development-and-training-package/,This interactive training package will provide line managers with the skills knowledge and resources to better manage poor performance and work towards improving KPI and productivity. This training aims to develop the line managers understanding of their role and responsibilities in managing performance for example with goal setting and communicating performance goals with their team. Timescales This is a one-day training programme from 10:00 to 16:00. Constraints XYZ Bakery has no HR function installed. The business has plans to expand so there will be the risk that new line managers will not have the skills to monitor performance therefore the business will need a toolkit to maintain consistency with new members of staff. As a small business there is a risk that sending all line managers and supervisors on a one-day training course may potentially put an economic strain on the business and temporally reduce productivity.  What is the main problem (in this company in terms of your group training topic area)? XYZ Bakery currently has no formal or consistent performance measures in place. Line Managers do not have the skills or confidence to monitor and manage poor performance. As the business is looking to expand in order to maintain consistency between multiple Bakery's managing performances is essential.  Participants will gain the skills to use effective communication techniques to motive and empower employees. They will be confident in developing strategies to monitor and manage poor performance setting quantifiable and SMART objectives and giving constructive feedback. The training will allow the business to maintain brand reputation through creating high performing business units as it expands across multiple sites. What should change as a result of the training? Participants will leave with a toolkit to empower them to better manage performance across all areas of the business. Performance management techniques will provide the line managers with the knowledge and resources to plan objectives which align with the overall business goals to potentially expand the business in the future.  Organisation Rationale (Organizational/business level due to business expansion): Following a successful launch the business is finding it a strain to continue to produce products at the quality set out in its mission and vision statements. It now wishes to formalise its sales targets to better monitor performance and strike a balance between quality and production. It wishes to get this right now as there are plans to expand by opening a further location and needs a template to roll out.  To ensure standards and quality are maintained through developing individual KPIs. The knowledge areas that the participants need to develop are: Coaching and Feedback  Coaching is an effective way to motivate and help employees to solve issues monitor performance and develop confidence in the workforce. Giving accurate balanced and timely feedback is an important aspect of performance management. Goal setting  Effective performance management requires goals to be specific measurable achievable relevant and time-based as well as setting clear expectations on how goals and objects will be evaluated.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/25/emba503-leading-digital-transformation-covid-19-pandemic/,Digital disruption has become a huge opportunity for large industries as well as small and medium-sized organisations. Covid 19 pandemic has massively affected most of the organizations in the world and the fluctuation in the world economy has further increased the challenges for the companies. In the current post covid situation the companies are trying to recover from the loss and find new opportunities to return to the normal profit. In this study the popular supermarket chain of USA Meijer has been chosen to better understand the need and possibilities of digitally transforming the business. The study will critically analyse the company and recommend suitable business strategies to reduce the risks in strategy. 1.Where are we now? Overview about business Meijer is a well-known retail company in the USA that operates almost 259 supermarkets and hypermarkets in different areas. The company was established in 1934 by Hendrik Meijer and had been operating for the last 87 years. The company's headquarters is settled in Walker Michigan the US and the CEO and President of the company is Rick Keyes. Most of the company's stores are in Michigan and the company also operates its stores in Indians Wisconsin Ohio Kentucky and Illinois (Meijer 2021). The company has been ranked 19 in the list of America's Largest Private Companiesù by Forbes magazine 2015 and 19 among 35 largest private companies of the US in 2008 by Fortune's magazine. The company mainly sells products like footwear groceries furniture sporting clothing gasoline beauty products electronics beddings pet supplies and housewares. Vision and mission As the originator of the one-stop shoppingù idea they provide exceptional customer experience cheap pricing high-quality goods and a wide variety of regional and Meijer brand merchandise. Nearly 30 years later his son Fred developed the country's first supercenter laying the groundwork for who they are present: worth billions of dollars retail household name (Meijer 2021). Meijer's tagline is Greater Quality Fewer Costsù yet their pickup lanes are more like Higher Sweet Fewer Nourishment.ù According to Meijer's webpage one of their fundamental values is to provide items and assistance to support our customers lead better lifestyles.ù Competitive advantage In order to analyse the competitive advantage of the company determining the competitors is the first step. Meijer can identify the competitors by determining the range of alternative products offered by the other companies. Apart from that understanding the existing and potential customers can also help the company to identify its competitive advantage. Meijer needs to keep in mind that providing value for money products cannot be a lifetime solution proper customer service uniquely providing service and other strategies also play a vital role in gaining competitive advantage (Koßyiƒüit and Tabak 2020). Conclusion: There are many giant supermarket chains like Tesco Walmart and others that also provide similar products and services and have a vast customer base. Digital transformation can help the company gain a great extent of competitive advantage as most companies are now struggling to convert their traditional business system digitally. Digital transformation business value Digital transformation has a considerable level of business value because of different necessities changing trends particularly the pandemic situation and making the business system futuristic (Chanias et al. 2019). In the traditional sense digital transformation means using modern Internet-based technologies and innovative ideas more efficiently and economically of value creation. Implementing a proper strategy of digital transformation can help Meijer to enhance its business value through the following aspects ‚óèDigital transformation can significantly reduce the cost of Communication. For example Meijer can cut the cost of interactions and exchanges through digital payments and online interaction methods. Moreover father mode using proper information technology can minimise data as the symmetry between different players in the market. ‚óèDigital transformation will also make everything way faster and accurate as well. All the processes can be monitored analysed and recorded using just some software and technologies. As a result the time of these processes will be drastically reduced and the company may focus on different fields of the company to improve in the saved time. ‚óèIn today's world most people are into social media and spend much time there. Meijer can use this to promote its products and services and attract customers' eyes online. ‚óèDuring the lockdown most supermarkets and hypermarkets were closed entirely and providing online-based home delivery can only be the solution to continue the business (Reis et al. 2018). Digital transformation can be the saviour of this kind of situation. ‚óèGetting customer feedback and reviews through online platforms also makes the system more fluid for the customers and for the company to monitor their reviews. SWOT analysis In order to formulate a proper business strategy identifying the weakness and strengths is necessary. In that case the SWOT analysis model can help. Strength  Weakness  Opportunity  Threats 1.In terms of strength the company has a significant market value as an ancient company operating a business in Michigan for the last 87 years. 2.Another thing is the number of stores the company currently operates. The local customers in different cities like Michigan Kentucky and so on enjoy the services from the company easily because of the 250+ stores. 3.Meijer is one of the largest supermarket chains and groceries in the United States. 4.Father mode the company has also taken part in different corporate social responsibilities and employed more than 80 thousand employees.  1. In terms of weaknesses the Company provides its product and services in a very small area. 2.Because of that the company does not earn that much revenue that its competitors like Walmart Kroger gain. 3.Another weakness of the company is that it does not have the latest innovative technologies and digital presence that other retail organisations currently have.   1.In terms of opportunities the company has a long list of opportunities. Among those the expansion of market opportunity comes first. The company has great potential to expand its business operations internationally. 2.On the other hand the company may also provide a wide range of products and services to the customers to attract customers of all requirements. 3.Digital disruption is also an excellent opportunity for the company to transform its business system into an online facility.   1.The United States has some of the most popular retail and grocery industries ruling the entire marketplace like Walmart Fry's and Remke. For that reason the company may face some tough competition. 2. On the other hand the list of videos for the new entrance opens the app to enter the retail industry and enhance the competition level. 3.The company does not have any unique business strategy because most of the customers have very low switching costs. 2.2. Where are we going? Problem statement and gap analysis The main issue of this study is to identify the opportunities for Meijer to transform digitally. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the United States' retail industry hard digital transformation has become the only way to recover. Erica Marie from the post-Covid situation and digital disruption can lead the company to gain a huge level of competitive advantage in the market. This is an excellent opportunity to increase profit and expand the business system to a broader area and a larger customer base. Business strategy models that respond to disruption In terms of implementing digital transformation or disruption technologies within the business system Beauty has many business models that the company may integrate with the organisational system. For example the subscription model can lead the organisation to gain a paid subscriber or customer base. On the other hand there are also different models like the marketplace model hypermarket model etc. The company can use the hypermarket model mainly because of its product range and service offerings. Currently this business model is used by great online retail industries like Amazon and Apple (thunderbird 2021). This disruption can be implemented within the organisation through brand bonding utilising sheer market power. Another business model is the pyramid model used by different online business companies like Microsoft and Amazon. In this business model the company has to disrupt by affiliating a commission-only model. Figure 1: Digital transformation pyramid model (Source: thedigitaltransformationpeople 2021) Goals The company's main goals will be to increase revenue sales through digital transformation and provide products and services to a broader customer base. In addition Meijer will optimise its organisational operations and processes using digital transformation strategy. In the initial stages of applying digital transformation strategy the company will convert all the company's information into code and then focus on developing an agile business structure. On the other hand in the top competition by global organisations digital transformation will allow the company to increase its competitive advantage to a higher level. Besides that the company can also aim to improve the overall customer satisfaction level through digital technologies. SMART objectives Smart objectives refer to five main factors to obtain proper organisational goals that are specific measurable attainable relevant and time-based. Specific: the company can get a particular number of online customers through the digital transformation. Measurable: this invention can also be measured through the different analytical tools available from digital service providers.  Actionable: the company may seek new action plans such as delivering products and services to the customers' doors by an online booking system. The company will also have to formulate a proper communication plan in this context where all the meetings and procedures will be included. Relevant: Meijer also has to identify the risk and challenges relevant to the digital transformation goals using the different digital technologies. Time schedule: For each action or planning Meijer has to create a proper time schedule that has to be maintained to get more accurate information and expected outcomes.

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/25/mktg-3204-marketing-research-techniques-strategic-growth-plan/,As of 2014 Wendy's (www.wendys.com) is the world's third largest quick-service hamburger company. The Wendy's system includes more than 6500 franchise and company restaurants in the United States and twenty-seven other countries and U.S. territories worldwide. Wendy's restaurants offer a standard menu featuring hamburgers and chicken breast sandwiches prepared to order with the customer's choice of condiments as well as chicken nuggets chili baked potatoes french fries salads desserts soft drinks and children's meals.  Dave Thomas the founder of Wendy's began his fast-food ca- reer in 1956 when he and Phil Clauss opened a barbecue restaurant in Knoxville Tennessee. He put his restaurant experience to use in 1969 by opening his first Wendy's restaurant naming it after his daughter. Thomas limited the menu to cooked-to-order hamburgers chili and shakes charging prices slightly higher than rivals Burger King and McDonald's. The restaurants were decorated with carpet- ing wood paneling and Tiffany-style lamps to reinforce the relatively upscale theme. In the early 1970s the company began franchising to accelerate expansion. It also founded its Management Institute to train owners and managers in Wendy's operational techniques. The first non-U.S. Wendy's opened in Canada in 1975. Wendy's went public in 1976 and by the end of that year it boasted a collection of 500 restaurants. Its first national commercial aired in 1977. Two years later the chain added a salad bar to its menu.  Dave Thomas retired as chairman in 1982 and took the title of senior chairman Wendy's launched an $8 million TV ad campaign featuring Clara Peller asking Where's the beef?ù in 1984 and its market share jumped to 12 percent. When McDonald's and Burger King responded with their own campaigns Wendy's introduction of a breakfast menu (1985); new products such as the Big Classic burger (1986); and the SuperBar buffet (1987) could not help reverse the erosion of the company's market share (down to 9 percent by 1987). With his honest demeanor and humble delivery Thomas found an audience as Wendy's TV spokesperson in 1989. The company even attributed the rebound in earnings at the time to his appearances.  Wendy's reacted to growing concern about nutrition by introducing a grilled chicken sandwich in 1990. It also appealed to budget- conscious consumers with its ninety-nine-cent Super Value Menu. Wendy's had 4000 restaurants by 1992 the same year it added packaged salads to its menu. The next year high school dropout Thomas earned his diploma; his class voted him Most Likely to Succeed.  The death of Dave Thomas early in 2002 was a crushing blow to the company and a loss for the fast-food industry. Wendy's con- tinued to perform well over the next three years even after losing its founder Dave Thomas. In November 2004 Wendy's decided to end its unsuccessful ad campaign featuring an everyman-type character an unofficial spokesmanù called Mr. Wendy because the campaign drew attention away from the food. This marks an ongoing dilemma for Wendy's: how to brand the company in the post-Thomas era. The company initiated a series of ads featuring still images of Dave Thomas in late November 2005 to commemorate the chain's thirty- fifth anniversary but the long-term question of its identity remained. During 2005 it started a campaign built around the call to action Do What Tastes Rightù which underscores Wendy's thirty-five-year her- itage of serving great tasting high-quality food. It featured a variety of different types of ads that were matched to targeted audiences. Included were advertising that promoted specific menu items as well as executions that supported the Wendy's brand as a whole.  In mid-2006 Wendy's International Inc. created a new area of marketing to lead innovation efforts for the Wendy's brand. The expanded role of Wendy's marketing department included the estab- lishment of an innovation and strategy group comprised of research and development strategic insights and innovation and operations innovation.  Wendy rolled out its strategic growth plan in October 2007 and identified ten imperatives for 2008. The imperatives are focused on Doing What's Right for Customers.ù The ten imperatives build on Wendy's Recipe for Successù which is focused on revitalizing the Wendy's brand streamlining and improving operations reclaiming innovation leadership strengthening franchisee commitment captur- ing new opportunities (e.g. international growth) and embracing a performance-driven culture.  In August 2008 Wendy's reached out to cash-strapped con- sumers with a trio of high-quality signature sandwiches priced at ninety-nine cents. It introduced a ninety-nine-cent Double Stack cheeseburger and planned to promote this menu option aggressively along with the company's popular ninety-nine-cent Junior Bacon Cheeseburger and ninety-nine-cent Crispy Chicken Sandwich. On September 29 2008 Triarc Companies Inc. the franchisor of the Arby's restaurant system completed its previously announced merger with Wendy's International Inc. The combined company was renamed Wendy's/Arby's Group Inc. Triarc subsequently sold Arby's in 2011.  Shortly after its acquisition by Triarc Wendy's undertook system- atic survey research in 2009 and 2010 interviewing 10000 consum- ers. The findings indicated that consumers liked the idea of fresh food with as little processing as possible and familiar ingredients. These findings led to the reinvention of Wendy's core menu. Out went the traditional iceberg lettuce topped with tomatoes and onions and in came four new salad History of Life After Dave Thomas MKTG 3204  Marketing Research Techniques (Fall 2020).   varieties featuring eleven different greens and new ingredients like apples pecans and asiago cheese. In 2011 Wendy's turned its attention to french fries switching from a mixture of potato varieties to only Russet potatoes sliced with the skin still on and sprinkled with sea salt. In March 2012 Wendy's introduced its new Spicy Chicken Guacamole Club that added even more flavors with a zesty ranch sauceîand yes guacamoleîto create a big bold tasty sandwich. More recently Wendy's beefed up its burgers switching to a looser grind of beef that made its burgers thicker and juicier. The company also refashioned its trademark square burgers with softer edges to give them a fresher more appealing look. As of 2014 Wendy's brand transformation was being engineered with bold restaurant designs innovative food and improved customer service.  To survive the merciless fast-food industry Wendy's conducted another survey.Wendy's wanted to study customer demographics and awareness of different competing fast-food chains; the satisfaction responses of consumers in terms of family rientation comfort price quick service healthy foods cleanliness and so on; and the patronage preferences of costumers in terms of eat-in or drive-through. The following questionnaire was used by Wendy's to obtain this information and the data obtained can be downloaded from the website for this book. Based on the data collected and analysis of this study Wendy's intends to improve its service and brand orientation.  Instructions: Answer the following questions within the stated word count limits.

Well they really didn't want to wait so they asked if they could just pop around and present their offer. He didn't mind at all so they got him to phone me and make the appointment. We negotiated the agreement around my dining room table! You know looking back I don't think that salesperson earned very much of his share of the commission at all!

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/26/kob-811-strategic-communication-management-risk-imposing-inappropriate/,A corporate communication strategy is not the same as a communication plan. Rather it indicates the direction that an organisation needs to take with regard to its communication with stakeholders. It can therefore be called a grand or long-term strategy determining in broad terms what needs to be done to create a competitive position with regard to stakeholders that is compatible with overall enterprise or corporate strategy. Communication is the means to an end namely to assist top management to improve business processes and the performance of the people involved in those processes. By only talking in terms of communication processes without identifying the underling business problem practitioners risk imposing inappropriate solutions.  A corporate communication strategy should support the business strategy and should help an organisation to compete more effectively by identifying what should be communicated to stakeholders to firstly solve problems (e.g. improve productivity); or secondly to capitalise on opportunities that are presented. An example would be when an organisation has already complied with new legislation about a product. Communicating this information to strategic stakeholders such as the government or investors would capitalise on an opportunityù (Steyn & Puth 2000:70).

https://scribing.shop/2021/11/26/rnsg-1209-introduction-to-nursing-holistic-view-of-death/,Thank you for sharing your professional experience with the dying process. The role of the nurse during the dying process is to respect cultural and spiritual beliefs assist patients through their personal experience of grieving process and help patients become aware of the greater whole. Understanding Kubler-Ross's Grief theory and the theory of self-transcendence will enable the nurse to manage the care of the older adult with dignity and respect. Taking a holistic view of death means understanding that death is an extension of the whole and the dying process should be a healing experience for both the individual and family. The role of th nurse is to facilitate the healing process by helping the individual and family achieve stability and work throui any or all the stages of grief (denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance). People can experience all some or none of the stages of grief. Subsequently. the nurse should be prepared to facilitate the grieving process that is specific to the patient and family. Another aspect of the nurse's role is to facilitate the patient': ability to rise above the self and grasp the idea of the greater whole to transcend the self and experience the healing during dying process.  In taking a deeper look at self-transcendence the focus is the capacity of an individual to expand self-boundaries toward a mature broader perspective of life. Expansion can occur intrapersonally through introspective reflective activities resulting in a increased awareness of one's personal philosophy and dream (Friske 2016 p. 267). The increased awareness assists the patient in developing intrapersonal interpersona and transpersonal strategies to cope with end-of-life and transition into the healing dying process (Laport & Vonarx 2016). Individuals and families need to rise beyond the self and seek out that which is greater. This introspection results in an understanding wholeness and interconnectedness. The nurse can facilitate the dyil process by respecting the cultural and spiritual beliefs and practices of the patient and family. Professor Reid.
