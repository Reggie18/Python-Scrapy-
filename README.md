# Python-Scrapy-
Web Scraping projects using the scrapy framework in python.

Scrapy is a fast high-level framework used mainly for web crawling and web scraping. Based off of its documentation, this framework provides huge advantages in
the realms of data mining, monitoring and automated testing of websites. 

My projects  here have mainly been focused on using scrapy for crawling and scraping structured websites.

For more javascript-heavy websites, implemention of scrapy-selenium has proven successful. You can read more about scrapy-selenium and its usage here:
